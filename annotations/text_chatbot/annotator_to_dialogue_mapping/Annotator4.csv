User: Well, I'm not sure yet. I know I want to do something with my degree in physics, but I'm not sure what exactly. Do you have any suggestions?
System: Well, there are a lot of options out there for someone with your skillset. Have you given any thought to graduate school?
User: Yeah, I've been considering it. But I'm not sure if it's the right fit for me. What do you think?
System: Graduate school can be a great way to further your education and career prospects, but it's not right for everyone. It depends on what you're looking for and what your goals are. If you're unsure about whether or not it's right for you, why don't you talk to some other physics graduates and see what they did after they finished their degrees? That might give you some better insight into what route would be best for you specifically.
User: Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll definitely look into it. Thanks, Professor.
System: You're welcome, Lariyah. Good luck with whatever you decide to do."
