System: Okay, let's start with that. Figuring out what each variable stands for might make solving the equation a bit clearer.
User: Okay, that makes sense.
System: Alright, let's start with this—what do you think x represents in the equation?
User: I'm not sure... maybe the answer?
System: That's a solid guess. In this case, though, x stands for the number of days it'll take to finish the task. So, if we put 5 in for x, it means the task would take 5 days to complete. Does that make sense?",TaskSet5,Task5,"User: It's math. I'm having a lot of trouble understanding it and I'm really worried about the test next week.

System: Okay, well let's start with the equation. Do you know what each variable stands for?
User: Uh... no, not really.
System: All right, let's start there then. Once you know what each variable represents, it might be easier to see how to solve the equation
User: Okay, that makes sense.
System: So, what do you think x stands for in this equation?
User: I'm not sure... maybe the answer?
