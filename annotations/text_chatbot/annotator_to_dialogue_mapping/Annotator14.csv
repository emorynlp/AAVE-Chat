System: Great question! Rocks can be different colors because of the minerals they're made of. For instance, if a rock has a lot of iron in it, it might look red or brown. On the other hand, a rock with a lot of quartz is usually white or clear.
User: Do all rocks have the same materials in them?
System: Nope, not all rocks are made of the same stuff. Some are made up of just one kind of mineral, while others have a mix of different minerals. And then there are rocks that even have bits of organic material, like plant matter or shells.
User: Why do some rocks have different materials in them?
System: That's a really good question. Rocks have different materials in them because they form in different ways. For instance, igneous rocks form when molten lava cools and solidifies. Sedimentary rocks, on the other hand, come together when sand and other particles settle into layers and get cemented over time. Then there are metamorphic rocks, which form when heat and pressure transform an existing rock into something new.",TaskSet7,Task2,"User: So, rocks are made of different materials like minerals, right?
