System: Listen here, lemme break it down real good fo' you. When we talkin' bout first person point of view, dat's when da one tellin' da story be right up in it, using words like ""I"" and ""we"" and whatnot. Like if I'm tellin' bout how ""I went to da store,"" see dat's first person 'cause I'm both tellin' it and doin' it. Now when we get to third person limited, chile, dat's when da one tellin' da story ain't in it at all, but dey only followin' one character's mind - using ""he"" or ""she"" instead of ""I"". Dey can only tell you what dat one person thinkin' and feelin', can't get in nobody else head. And den we got third person omniscient - dat's when da storytella knows errythang bout errybody in da story - all dey thoughts, all dey feelings, da whole nine yards.

User: Yeah, I think so. It's like how the story is being told, right? Who is telling the story?
System: Exactly. So there are three different points of view that writers can use when crafting a story - first person, third person limited, and third person omniscient. Do you remember what those are?
User: Not entirely... Could you remind me?
System: Sure. First person point of view is when the narrator of the story is also a character in the story, and they refer to themselves using ""I"" or ""we"". An example of this would be if I were writing a story and said ""I went to the store"", then that would be first person point of view because I am both the narrator and a character in the story. Third person limited point of view is when the narrator is not a character in the story but they still use ""he"" or ""she"" instead of ""I"". This means that they can only give information about what one character is thinking or feeling - they don't have access to any other characters' thoughts or feelings.

Like if I'm telling a story saying ""I went to the store"" - that's first person 'cause I'm both telling it and living it. Now, third person limited is different - the person telling the story ain't in it, and they using ""he"" or ""she"". They can only tell you what's going on in one character's head at a time. And then we got third person omniscient, where the storyteller knows every single thing about everybody in the story - all their thoughts, all their feelings, everything.

User: Not entirely... Could you remind me?
System: Sure. First person point of view is when the narrator of the story is also a character in the story, and they refer to themselves using ""I"" or ""we"". An example of this would be if I were writing a story and said ""I went to the store"", then that would be first person point of view because I am both the narrator and a character in the story. Third person limited point of view is when the narrator is not a character in the story but they still use ""he"" or ""she"" instead of ""I"". This means that they can only give information about what one character is thinking or feeling - they don't have access to any other characters' thoughts or feelings. And finally, third person omniscient point of view is when the narrator knows everything about all of the characters in the story - their thoughts, their feelings, everything. Does that make sense?

System: It was nothin', happy to chat with ya. What's been on ya mind that you wanted to discuss?
User: Well, I was just wondering if you could tell me a little bit more about the material we covered in class today. I wasn't able to take very many notes and I'm feeling a little bit lost.
System: Aight, lemme break it down for ya. So we was goin' over point of view in literature today. You recall what that's all about?
User: Yeah, I think so. It's like how the story is being told, right? Who is telling the story?
System: Yeah, that's right. Now, when it comes to point of view, writers got three main options to choose from: first person, third person limited, and third person omniscient. You recall what them terms mean?
User: Not entirely... Could you remind me?
System: Let me give you the lowdown. First person point of view is when the person tellin' the story is also somebody in the story, and they talk about themselves usin' ""I"" or ""we"". For instance, if I was writin' a story and said ""I went to the store"", that'd be first person 'cause I'm both the one tellin' the story and a character in it. Then you got third person limited, where the person tellin' the story ain't in it, but they use ""he"" or ""she"" instead of ""I"". That means they can only share what one character's thinkin' or feelin', 'cause they can't get inside nobody else's head. Last, you got third person omniscient, where the person tellin' the story knows everythin' 'bout all the characters - what they're thinkin', what they're feelin', all that.
User: Yes, definitely! Thank you for explaining it so thoroughly.
System: I'm glad I could help clarify things for ya. Now, you got any other questions or topics you wanna touch on?",TaskSet7,Task8,"User: Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me, I really appreciate it.

System: Sure, no problem. Let's see, what did we cover today... Oh, right! We were discussing point of view in literature. Do you remember what that is?
User: Yeah, I think so. It's like how the story is being told, right? Who is telling the story?
System: Exactly. So there are three different points of view that writers can use when crafting a story - first person, third person limited, and third person omniscient. Do you remember what those are?

User: Well, I was just wondering if you could tell me a little bit more about the material we covered in class today. I wasn't able to take very many notes and I'm feeling a little bit lost.
System: Listen, I'd be happy to help you out. Let me think about what we covered... Oh yes! We were talking about point of view in literature. You remember anything about that?
User: Yeah, I think so. It's like how the story is being told, right? Who is telling the story?
System: That's right, honey. Now, there's three different points of view writers can use when they crafting a story - first person, third person limited, and third person omniscient. You remember what those are about?
User: Not entirely... Could you remind me?
System: Let me break that down for you. First person point of view is when the narrator's telling their own story, using ""I"" or ""we"". Like if I wrote ""I went to the store"" - that's first person because I'm both telling and living the story. Now, third person limited is different - the narrator's on the outside looking in, using ""he"" or ""she"", but they can only tell you what one character's thinking or feeling. They don't know what's going on in everybody else's head. And then there's third person omniscient, where the narrator knows everything about everybody - all their thoughts, all their feelings, the whole nine yards. That make things clearer for you?
