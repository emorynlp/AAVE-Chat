,,Chatbot,,"Listen here, you were dealin' with a condition they call sepsis.",,,,,"Well, Jack, you were suffering from a condition called sepsis.",,,
,,User,,What is that?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Look, sepsis is when your body gets hit with a real serious infection. What happens is your immune system starts workin' too hard to fight it off, and that can mess with your organs somethin' terrible - even be fatal if it ain't treated right.",,,,,"Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by an infection.

,,User,,What caused it?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well, we ain't completely sure about that. Could've been somethin' as simple as a cut on your hand that got infected. But whatever started it, your body just couldn't fight it off right and it began affectin' your organs.",,,,,"We're not entirely sure. It could have been something as simple as a cut on your hand that got infected. But whatever the cause, your body was not able to fight it off and it started to affect your organs.",,,
,,User,,Is there anything I can do to prevent it from happening again?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Listen, there's no guaranteed way to prevent sepsis, but I can tell you some things to help lower your risk. You gotta make sure to clean any cuts or scrapes right when they happen, and don't hesitate to see a doctor if they start gettin' red or swollen. And make sure you stay up to date with those vaccinations your doctor recommends.",,,,,"There is no guaranteed way to prevent sepsis, but there are some things you can do to lower your risk.
