,,User,,"Hi! I'm looking for a travel backpack, water bottle, and map.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,Sure thing! We've got plenty of choices for all of those. Let's start with backpacks—are there any specific features you're hoping for?,,,,,Great! We have a lot of options for each of those items. Let's start with backpacks. Do you have any particular features in mind that you're looking for?,,,
,,User,,"Yes, I need one that's big enough to fit all my stuff, but not too big or bulky. And it needs to be comfortable to wear for long periods of time.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Alright, we've got a couple of options that could be a good fit. One of them is on the larger side, but it has adjustable straps to keep it secure and comfortable. Plus, it's got plenty of compartments and pockets to help you stay organized. Another option is a bit smaller, but it features padded shoulder straps and comes in a bunch of different colors.",,,,,"Okay, we have a few different options that might work for you.

,,User,,"I want something lightweight and easy to carry around, so plastic is fine. As far as size goes, something that holds at least 24 ounces would be ideal.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"We've got lots of great choices for you. One option is a 32-ounce bottle made from recycled materials, and it comes with a screw-on lid and a handy carrying loop. Another one is a 24-ounce bottle made from BPA-free plastic, and it's got a flip-top spout that makes it super easy to drink from while you're out and about.",,,,,"We have plenty of options that fit those criteria. This bottle is made from recycled materials and has a screw-on lid with a carrying loop. It holds 32 ounces so it's a good option if you're looking for something larger.
