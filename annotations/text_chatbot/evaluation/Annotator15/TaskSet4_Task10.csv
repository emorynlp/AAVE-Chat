,,User,,What do they mean?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Look here, let me explain. The first word is ""abandon."" It means to leave something or someone behind.

,,User,,"Okay, I got it. What's the next one?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well, I'ma tell you about ""reluctant."" That means when somebody ain't really trying to do something - they hesitating about it. Like when it's raining outside and you standing by the door not wanting to step out 'cause you don't wanna get wet - that's being reluctant right there.",,,,,"The next word is ""reluctant.""

For example, if you're reluctant to go outside because it's raining, that means you don't really want to go outside because you don't want to get wet.",,,
,,User,,Got it. What's the next one?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Listen, the next word we're looking at is ""cease."" It means when something stops or comes to an end.

,,User,,"Okay, I understand that one too. What about the last two words?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Let me break down these last two words for you. The fourth one, ""devastate,"" that's when something causes real bad damage or destruction - like when a fire tears through a city and destroys all them buildings and homes. Now the last word, ""languish,"" that's what happens when somebody's suffering from being bored or neglected. Like when somebody's locked up in jail with no visitors and nothing to do all day - they just sitting there languishing, you understand what I'm saying?",,,,,"The fourth word on the list is ""devastate."" Devastate means to cause great damage or destruction. For example, a fire can devastate a city by destroying many buildings and homes. And the last word on the list is ""languish."" Languish means to suffer from boredom or neglect. For example, a prisoner might languish in jail because he's not getting any visitors and he's bored out of his mind with nothing to do all day long",,,
