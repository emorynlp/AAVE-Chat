,,User,,So there are eight planets in the solar system?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Yeah, that's correct.",,,,,"Yes, that's right.",,,
,,User,,And they all orbit the sun?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"That's right, they do.",,,,,That's correct.,,,
,,User,,What determines their orbit? Is it just their distance from the sun?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Nah, it ain't just 'bout how far they is from the sun, hun. See, each planet got its own special way it move 'round the sun. Like, some planets is way closer to the sun than others, and den some got them elliptical orbits, while others is more circular, ya hear?",,,,,"No, it's not just their distance from the sun. Each planet has a different orbital path. For example, some planets are closer to the sun than others, and some have elliptical orbits while others have more circular orbits.",,,
,,User,,So it sounds like there is a lot of variation in how the planets orbit the sun.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Yessiree, variation's the name of the game when it comes to them planets orbitin' the sun. But at the end of the day, it's all 'bout the sun's gravity, 'cause that's what's pullin' on each planet, makin' 'em move the way they do.",,,,,"Yes, there is quite a bit of variation. But ultimately, it all comes down to gravity. The gravity of the sun pulls on each planet and causes them to orbit around it.",,,
,,User,,"That makes sense. I'm just curious, why don't they all fall into the sun?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"It's like, the planets is movin' so fast 'round the sun, they ain't never gettin' close enough to actually fall in. See, if dey was just droppin' straight down towards the sun, den yeah, dey'd eventually fall right on in.",,,,,"Well, if they were falling straight towards the sun, then they would eventually fall into it. But because they are orbiting around the sun, they never get close enough to actually fall into it.",,,
