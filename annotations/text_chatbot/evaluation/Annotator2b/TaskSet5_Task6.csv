,,User,,Because it just feels good to be liked by lots of people. It makes me feel important and like I matter.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"But that really make ya happy tho? Or you just frontin', tryna blend in wit' everybody?",,,,,But does it really make you happy? Or are you just putting on a facade to try and fit in?,,,
,,User,,I don't know. I guess I just want people to like me for who I am.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,So you think bein' all popular gon' make folks see the real you like that?,,,,,And you think being popular will help with that?,,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I guess so. If people see that lots of other people like me, then they'll be more likely to like me too.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,But what if they ain't really feelin' you for who you is? What if they just ridin' yo wave tryna level up they own clout?,,,,,But what if they don't actually like you for who you are? What if they're just using you to try and boost their own popularity?,,,
,,User,,I don't know. I guess that would hurt pretty badly.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"So maybe it ain't even worth all that, if it mean you might end up hurtin' yo'self in the mix.",,,,,"So maybe it's not worth it then, if there's a chance you could end up getting hurt in the process.",,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I guess you're right. It's just really hard sometimes when it feels like everyone else is having fun and you're not part of it.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Yeah, I feel you on that. But maybe 'stead of tryna squeeze up in wit' the popular folks, you could find yo own lil' crew that rock wit' you just how you is. That way, you gon' always got folks holdin' you down, no matter what them popular kids be on.",,,,,"Yeah, I know how that feels. But maybe instead of trying to force your way into the popular crowd, you could find your own group of friends who accept you for who you are. That way, you'll always have a supportive group around you, no matter what happens with the popular kids at school",,,
