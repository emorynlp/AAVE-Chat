,,Chatbot,,"Aight, we got a few options that could work for you. This one right here is a little bigger, but it got adjustable straps so you can make it fit nice and snug.

This one right here made from recycled materials, got a screw-on lid with a carry loop, and holds 32 ounces—real good if you want somethin' a lil bigger. Or, you could go with this one made from BPA-free plastic, got a flip-top spout for easy sippin', and holds 24 ounces—just right for most folks.",,,,,"We have plenty of options that fit those criteria.
