,,User,,Because it just feels good to be liked by lots of people. It makes me feel important and like I matter.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Hold up, lemme ask you somethin'. Does all them likes really bring you joy, or is you just frontin' to fit in with the crowd?",,,,,But does it really make you happy? Or are you just putting on a facade to try and fit in?,,,
,,User,,I don't know. I guess I just want people to like me for who I am.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Now I'm wonderin', do you really think bein' popular's gonna make folks like you for who you truly are?",,,,,And you think being popular will help with that?,,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I guess so. If people see that lots of other people like me, then they'll be more likely to like me too.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Here's the thing, though - what if people ain't likin' you for the real you, but just 'cause they think it'll make 'em look good to be associated with you?",,,,,But what if they don't actually like you for who you are? What if they're just using you to try and boost their own popularity?,,,
,,User,,I don't know. I guess that would hurt pretty badly.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"You might wanna think 'bout whether it's worth the risk, considerin' you could end up gettin' hurt in all this.",,,,,"So maybe it's not worth it then, if there's a chance you could end up getting hurt in the process.",,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I guess you're right. It's just really hard sometimes when it feels like everyone else is having fun and you're not part of it.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"I hear ya, it can be tough when it seems like everybody else is havin' a good time and you're on the outside lookin' in.",,,,,"Yeah, I know how that feels. But maybe instead of trying to force your way into the popular crowd, you could find your own group of friends who accept you for who you are. That way, you'll always have a supportive group around you, no matter what happens with the popular kids at school",,,
