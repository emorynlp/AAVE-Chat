,,Chatbot,,"Aight, lemme show ya what we got. We got a few backpacks that might fit what you're lookin' for.

,,Chatbot,,"We got several options dat fit what you're lookin' for. Dis one's made from recycled materials, got a screw-on lid wit' a carryin' loop, and it holds 32 ounces, so it's a good choice if you want somethin' a lil' bigger. Den we got dis other one, made from BPA-free plastic, got a flip-top spout for easy sippin' on da go, and it holds 24 ounces, which should be plenty for most folks' needs.",,,,,"We have plenty of options that fit those criteria.
