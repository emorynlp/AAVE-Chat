,,User,,Thank you so much for unblocking my account!,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"You're welcome. Let me know if there's anything else you need, aight?",,,,,You're welcome. Is there anything else I can do for you?,,,
,,User,,"Well, I was wondering why my account was blocked in the first place.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"My bad for the trouble, but we had to block your account 'cause of some suspicious activity.",,,,,"We're sorry for the inconvenience, but we had to block your account due to suspicious activity.",,,
,,User,,What kind of suspicious activity?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"We saw some info on your account wasn't lining up with what we got on file. Like, your email address didn't match the one we had recorded.",,,,,"We noticed that some of the information on your account didn't match up with what we have on file. For example, your email address was different than what we have on record.",,,
,,User,,That's because I changed it recently. Is that a problem?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Nah, not really. But it did catch our attention. Plus, we saw you been loggin' in from a bunch of different IP addresses. That ain't always an issue, but it's somethin' we gotta look at when we check for suspicious activity.",,,,,"No, not necessarily. But it did raise a red flag for us. In addition, we noticed that you've been logging into your account from multiple IP addresses. Again, this isn't necessarily a problem, but it is something that we take into consideration when looking at suspicious activity.",,,
,,User,,"I see. Well, I can understand why you would be suspicious in those cases. But I assure you, there is no nefarious activity going on. I simply changed my email address and have been using a VPN to log in from different locations.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"We appreciate you bein' patient with us. We're glad to get your account unblocked now that we've confirmed everything's all good. Thanks for takin' the time to talk it out with us, and you have yourself a good day!",,,,,"We appreciate your understanding, Oumou. We're happy to unblock your account now that we've verified that the activity was indeed innocent. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us and have a great day!",,,
