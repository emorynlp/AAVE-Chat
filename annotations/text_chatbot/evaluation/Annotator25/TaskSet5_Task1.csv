,,User,,"Well, I was wondering why my account was blocked in the first place.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Lawd have mercy, we had to block ya account 'cause we got a red flag 'bout some shady activity goin on.",,,,,"We're sorry for the inconvenience, but we had to block your account due to suspicious activity.",,,

For example, your email address was different than what we have on record.",,,
,,User,,That's because I changed it recently. Is that a problem?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Nah, dat ain't necessarily da problem, but it sho nuff raised a red flag fo sho. Den we also peeped dat ya been loggin in from multiple IP addresses, 'n dat's somethin we take into consideration when we lookin at suspicious activity, ya hear?",,,,,"No, not necessarily. But it did raise a red flag for us. In addition, we noticed that you've been logging into your account from multiple IP addresses. Again, this isn't necessarily a problem, but it is something that we take into consideration when looking at suspicious activity.",,,
,,User,,"I see. Well, I can understand why you would be suspicious in those cases. But I assure you, there is no nefarious activity going on. I simply changed my email address and have been using a VPN to log in from different locations.",,,,,,,,
