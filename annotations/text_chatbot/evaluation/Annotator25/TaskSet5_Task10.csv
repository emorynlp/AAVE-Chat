,,User,,Thank you so much for unblocking my account!,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,Sure thing! Is there anything else I can help you with?,,,,,You're welcome. Is there anything else I can do for you?,,,
,,User,,"Well, I was wondering why my account was blocked in the first place.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Sorry about the hassle, but we had to block your account because of some suspicious activity.",,,,,"We're sorry for the inconvenience, but we had to block your account due to suspicious activity.",,,
,,User,,What kind of suspicious activity?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"We saw that some of the details on your account didn't line up with what we've got on file. For instance, the email address on your account didn't match the one we have recorded.",,,,,"We noticed that some of the information on your account didn't match up with what we have on file. For example, your email address was different than what we have on record.",,,
,,User,,That's because I changed it recently. Is that a problem?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Not really, but it did catch our attention. Plus, we noticed you've been logging in from a bunch of different IP addresses. That's not always an issue, but it's something we keep an eye on when we're checking for anything unusual.",,,,,"No, not necessarily. But it did raise a red flag for us. In addition, we noticed that you've been logging into your account from multiple IP addresses. Again, this isn't necessarily a problem, but it is something that we take into consideration when looking at suspicious activity.",,,
,,User,,"I see. Well, I can understand why you would be suspicious in those cases. But I assure you, there is no nefarious activity going on. I simply changed my email address and have been using a VPN to log in from different locations.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"We really appreciate you understanding where we're coming from. Your account's all set now that we've confirmed everything checks out. Thanks for chatting with us, and take care!",,,,,"We appreciate your understanding, Oumou. We're happy to unblock your account now that we've verified that the activity was indeed innocent. Thank you for taking the time to speak with us and have a great day!",,,
