,,User,,"Yeah, ever since my wife died. It's like I can't get over her death and move on with my life. I know it's been a year now, but it feels like it just happened yesterday.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Listen here sugar, losin' ya wife like dat ain't no small thang - dat pain run deep. Grief be hittin' different and it don't care 'bout no timeline neither. You been havin' trouble catchin' dem z's or keepin' food down? And I gotta ask - you feelin' like ain't nothin' gon' get better?",,,,,That's understandable. grief can be very debilitating and make it difficult to function normally. Have you been having trouble sleeping or eating? Feeling hopeless or helpless?,,,
,,User,,"Yeah, all of those things. I've lost interest in everything I used to enjoy and drinking has become my crutch. But even that doesn't make me feel better anymore.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Look here, what you goin' through ain't no joke. Depression be real heavy and you can't jus' shake it off by yaself.

,,Chatbot,,"Lemme keep it a buck witchu - depression ain't just in ya head, it's a whole medical situation dat need proper treatment, ya heard? Folks be thinkin' therapy just bout cryin' and talkin', but it's deeper den dat - it help you make sense of all dem heavy thoughts and feelings weighin' you down. And dem meds? They ain't nothin' to be scared of - they work on ya brain chemistry just like medicine for high blood pressure do for ya heart, feel me? Both dem thangs together can help lift dis dark cloud you been under.",,,,,"Adelynne, it's important to understand that depression is a real medical condition that requires treatment. Therapy can be very helpful in exploring the thoughts and emotions that are contributing to your depression. Medication can also be effective in reducing symptoms.",,,
