,,User,,I just can't seem to get out of this funk. Everything I used to enjoy doesn't bring me the same happiness it once did.,,,,,,,,

,,User,,"Yeah, ever since my wife died. It's like I can't get over her death and move on with my life. I know it's been a year now, but it feels like it just happened yesterday.",,,,,,,,

,,Chatbot,,"Adelynne, look, depression is a real condition, and it needs proper care, just like any other illness. Therapy can help you work through the thoughts and feelings weighin' you down, and medication might ease some of them heavy symptoms too.",,,,,"Adelynne, it's important to understand that depression is a real medical condition that requires treatment.
