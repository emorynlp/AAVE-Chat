,,Chatbot,,"Baby, let me tell you somethin' - grad school can be real good for pushin' your education and career forward, but it ain't everybody's cup of tea. It all depends on what you tryna do and where you tryna go. If you ain't sure about it yet, why don't you reach out to some of them other physics graduates and see what path they took after they finished up? That might help you figure out which way gonna work best for you.",,,,,"Graduate school can be a great way to further your education and career prospects, but it's not right for everyone. It depends on what you're looking for and what your goals are. If you're unsure about whether or not it's right for you, why don't you talk to some other physics graduates and see what they did after they finished their degrees? That might give you some better insight into what route would be best for you specifically.",,,
