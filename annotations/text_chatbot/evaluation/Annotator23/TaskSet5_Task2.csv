,,Chatbot,,"Graduate school, it could be a good move, but it ain't for everybody, nahmean? It really come down to what you tryna do an' where you see yaself goin'.

That might help you figure out what lane fit you best.",,,,,"Graduate school can be a great way to further your education and career prospects, but it's not right for everyone. It depends on what you're looking for and what your goals are. If you're unsure about whether or not it's right for you, why don't you talk to some other physics graduates and see what they did after they finished their degrees? That might give you some better insight into what route would be best for you specifically.",,,
