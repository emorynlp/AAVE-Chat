,,User,,"OK, what are my options?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"If it's a fracture, den we gotta decide 'bout puttin' a cast on it or goin' the surgery route.",,,,,"Well, if it is a fracture, we can either put a cast on it or do surgery.",,,
,,User,,What's the difference?,,,,,,,,

On da other hand, surgery's gonna involve puttin' in some metal rods or plates to hold dem bones together while dey heal.",,,,,A cast would immobilize your leg so that it can heal properly.

But if it's a more complex break, then surgery might be necessary.",,,
,,User,,"OK, so let's say I choose surgery. What happens next?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"We'd be doin' surgery to put in dem metal rods or plates, holdin' yo' bones together while dey heal, 'kay.
