,,User,,"Hi, I bought a ticket to the movies earlier today but I regretted it as soon as I got home. Is there any way I can get a refund?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Look here, we don't do refunds on them movie tickets.",,,,,"I'm sorry, but we don't offer refunds for movie tickets.",,,
,,User,,But I didn't even go to the movies! I changed my mind as soon as I got home.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Baby girl, I hear what you sayin', but we still can't do no refund on that ticket. When they say all sales final, that's just what it is - even if you ain't make it to the show.",,,,,"Even if you didn't go to the movies, we can't give you a refund. All sales are final.",,,
,,User,,This is ridiculous! How am I supposed to know if I'll like a movie or not if I haven't even seen it yet?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Listen, I understand your frustration, but what you can do is check out them trailers before you buy your ticket next time. That way you gon' know what the movie about and if it's something you really wanna see.",,,,,"Well, you could always try watching a trailer before you buy your ticket. That way, you'll have a better idea of what the movie is about and whether or not you'll enjoy it.",,,
,,User,,"That's not the point! The point is that your policy is unfair and unreasonable. There should be some flexibility when it comes to refunds for movie tickets. Otherwise, people will just end up wasting their money on movies they don't even want to see.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well sugar, I gotta keep it real with you - ain't nothing we can do about that situation. Like I been telling you, when them sales final, they final.",,,,,"Sorry, but there's nothing we can do. Like I said, all sales are final.",,,
,,User,,Fine. I'll never buy a ticket from your theater again.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well now, I understand how you feel, but that's your choice to make. Have yourself a blessed day.",,,,,Sorry to hear that. Have a nice day.,,,
