,,User,,So there are eight planets in the solar system?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Sho nuff, dats facts.",,,,,"Yes, that's right.",,,
,,User,,And they all orbit the sun?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Mhmm, you speakin' da truth right there. All dem planets be circlin' round dat sun like it ain't no thang.",,,,,That's correct.,,,
,,User,,What determines their orbit? Is it just their distance from the sun?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Nah baby, it ain't just how far dey is from da sun. Each one of dem planets got they own special path dey follow. Like some of em stay real close to da sun, while others be way out there, and some be movin' in dem oval shapes while others go round and round in circles, ya heard me?",,,,,"No, it's not just their distance from the sun. Each planet has a different orbital path. For example, some planets are closer to the sun than others, and some have elliptical orbits while others have more circular orbits.",,,
,,User,,So it sounds like there is a lot of variation in how the planets orbit the sun.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Listen here, it be like dis - we got all kinda different ways dem planets move round dat sun. But when you get down to da nitty gritty, it's all bout dat gravity doe. Da sun's gravity be pullin' on each one of dem planets, makin' em go round and round like dey do.",,,,,"Yes, there is quite a bit of variation. But ultimately, it all comes down to gravity. The gravity of the sun pulls on each planet and causes them to orbit around it.",,,
,,User,,"That makes sense. I'm just curious, why don't they all fall into the sun?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Look here sista, if dem planets was fallin' straight at da sun, den yeah, dey would end up fallin' right into it fo' real. But see, since dey be orbitin' round and round dat sun, dey stays just far enough away where dey can't never fall in, feel me?",,,,,"Well, if they were falling straight towards the sun, then they would eventually fall into it. But because they are orbiting around the sun, they never get close enough to actually fall into it.",,,
