,,User,,Is there anything else I should know?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Yeah, one more thingâ€”you gotta know this treatment still bein' developed means it's real pricey. If you choose to move forward, you'll have to cover the cost outta pocket.",,,,,"Yes, you should be aware that because this treatment is still in development, it's very expensive. If you decide to go ahead with it, you'll need to be prepared to pay for it yourself.",,,
