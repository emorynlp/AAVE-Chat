,,User,,"Doctor, I've been doing a lot of research and I think I might want to try an experimental treatment for my cancer.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Aight, that's somethin' worth thinkin' 'bout. But just so you know, experimental treatments can be real risky. Ain't no promise they'll work, and they might come with some heavy side effects.",,,,,"That's definitely something to consider. But you should know that experimental treatments come with a lot of risks. There's no guarantee that they will work, and they can often have serious side effects.",,,
,,User,,I understand the risks. But I'm willing to try anything that might help me beat this cancer.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Alright then, let's break down what this treatment's all about. The medicine's still in the works, so we ain't got all the answers on how it does its thing just yet. We're hopin' it'll work well for your type of cancer, but we can't say for sure till you give it a shot.",,,,,"Well, let's talk about what this particular treatment involves. The medication is still in development, so we don't know a lot about how it works yet. We're hopeful that it will be effective against your type of cancer, but we won't know for sure until you try it.",,,
,,User,,What are the side effects?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"We ain't got the full picture on that yet. Some folks done said they had nausea, throwin' up, feelin' real tired, and gettin' dizzy. Plus, there's a possibility it might mess with your liver or bring on some other serious health issues.",,,,,"Again, we're not entirely sure. Some patients have reported nausea and vomiting, fatigue, and dizziness. There's also a chance that the medication could cause liver damage or other serious health problems.",,,
,,User,,Is there anything else I should know?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Yeah, one more thing you gotta knowâ€”since this treatment still in the works, it's real pricey. If you choose to move forward, you gon' have to cover the cost outta pocket.",,,,,"Yes, you should be aware that because this treatment is still in development, it's very expensive. If you decide to go ahead with it, you'll need to be prepared to pay for it yourself.",,,
