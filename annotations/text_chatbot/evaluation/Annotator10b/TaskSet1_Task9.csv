,,User,,"Hi, I bought a ticket to the movies earlier today but I regretted it as soon as I got home. Is there any way I can get a refund?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"I feel ya, but our policy is we don't do refunds on movie tickets.",,,,,"I'm sorry, but we don't offer refunds for movie tickets.",,,
,,User,,But I didn't even go to the movies! I changed my mind as soon as I got home.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Even though you didn't end up goin' to the movies, our policy is clear: all sales are final, so we can't offer no refunds.",,,,,"Even if you didn't go to the movies, we can't give you a refund. All sales are final.",,,
,,User,,This is ridiculous! How am I supposed to know if I'll like a movie or not if I haven't even seen it yet?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"You could try watchin' a trailer beforehand, that way you'll get a better idea of what the movie's about and if it's somethin' you'd be into.",,,,,"Well, you could always try watching a trailer before you buy your ticket. That way, you'll have a better idea of what the movie is about and whether or not you'll enjoy it.",,,
,,User,,"That's not the point! The point is that your policy is unfair and unreasonable. There should be some flexibility when it comes to refunds for movie tickets. Otherwise, people will just end up wasting their money on movies they don't even want to see.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"I hear where you're comin' from, but I gotta reiterate, our policy is set in stone - all sales are final, and we can't make exceptions.",,,,,"Sorry, but there's nothing we can do. Like I said, all sales are final.",,,
,,User,,Fine. I'll never buy a ticket from your theater again.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"I'm gonna miss havin' you as a customer, but I wish you all the best.",,,,,Sorry to hear that. Have a nice day.,,,
