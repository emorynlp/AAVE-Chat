,,User,,"OK, what are my options?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Look here, we got two ways to handle that fracture - we can either wrap it up in a cast or go on ahead with surgery.",,,,,"Well, if it is a fracture, we can either put a cast on it or do surgery.",,,
,,User,,What's the difference?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Listen, lemme break it down for you - puttin' a cast on gon' keep that leg still so it can heal right. Now surgery, that's where they put them metal rods and plates up in there to hold them bones together while they healin'.",,,,,A cast would immobilize your leg so that it can heal properly. Surgery would involve putting metal rods or plates in your leg to hold the bones together while they heal.,,,
,,User,,Is one better than the other?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well baby girl, it really come down to how bad that break is. If we talkin' bout a simple fracture, then puttin' a cast on there should do just fine. But if that break more complicated than that, then we might need to look into that surgery option.",,,,,"It really depends on the severity of the fracture. If it's a simple break, then a cast should be fine. But if it's a more complex break, then surgery might be necessary.",,,
,,User,,"OK, so let's say I choose surgery. What happens next?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Look here sis, what we gon' do is put you under and get them metal rods or plates fixed up in your leg to hold them bones together while they heal up proper. Most folks be back on their feet in about 6 to 8 weeks.",,,,,We would do an operation to insert metal rods or plates into your leg to hold the bones together while they heal. Recovery time is usually around 6-8 weeks.,,,
,,User,,And if I choose a cast?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well sugar, we'd put either one of them plaster or fiberglass casts on that leg to keep it from movin' around while it heals up right. Most folks be back to normal in about 4 to 6 weeks or so.",,,,,We would put a plaster or fiberglass cast on your leg that would immobilize it so that it can heal properly. Recovery time is usually around 4-6 weeks.,,,
