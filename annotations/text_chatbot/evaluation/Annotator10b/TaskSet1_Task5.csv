,,User,,"Hi, I bought a ticket to the movies earlier today but I regretted it as soon as I got home. Is there any way I can get a refund?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"I'm sorry, but we don't do refunds on movie tickets.",,,,,"I'm sorry, but we don't offer refunds for movie tickets.",,,
,,User,,But I didn't even go to the movies! I changed my mind as soon as I got home.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Look, even if you ain't go to the movies, we still can't give you no refund. All sales final, that's just how it is.",,,,,"Even if you didn't go to the movies, we can't give you a refund. All sales are final.",,,
,,User,,This is ridiculous! How am I supposed to know if I'll like a movie or not if I haven't even seen it yet?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well, you might wanna check out a trailer next time before you buy a ticket. That way, you can get a feel for what the movie's about and see if it's somethin' you'd enjoy.",,,,,"Well, you could always try watching a trailer before you buy your ticket. That way, you'll have a better idea of what the movie is about and whether or not you'll enjoy it.",,,
,,User,,"That's not the point! The point is that your policy is unfair and unreasonable. There should be some flexibility when it comes to refunds for movie tickets. Otherwise, people will just end up wasting their money on movies they don't even want to see.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Sorry, but it ain't nothin' we can do 'bout that. Like I said, all sales final.",,,,,"Sorry, but there's nothing we can do. Like I said, all sales are final.",,,
