,,User,,"Professor, I'm sorry to interrupt, but could you go over the material from last lecture again? I wasn't able to get all of the notes and I want to make sure I understand everything.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Now, lemme see if I can dig up them notes from last time. Ah, got 'em right here. Now, where we gonna start at?",,,,,"Of course, Izaac. Let me see if I can find my notes from that lecture. Ah, here they are. Now, where should we start?",,,
,,User,,"Well, could you explain what a limit is again? I didn't quite understand that concept.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"A'ight, lemme break it down fo' ya. A limit is basically just a way of definin' a function as it approaches a certain point, 'kay? For example, if we got a function f(x) that approaches infinity as x goes to infinity, we would say that the limit of f(x) as x goes to infinity is infinity.",,,,,"Sure. A limit is basically just a way of defining a function as it approaches a certain point. For example, if we have a function f(x) that approaches infinity as x goes to infinity, we would say that the limit of f(x) as x goes to infinity is infinity.",,,
,,User,,"Okay, that makes sense. But how do we actually calculate limits?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Now, when it comes to calculatin' limits, we got a few different approaches, dependin' on the function we're dealin' with. See, sometimes we can just plug in the value we're approachin' and observe what happens, but other times we gotta bust out them more advanced methods, like L'Hopital's rule or Taylor series expansions.",,,,,"Well, there are a few different ways depending on the function involved. Sometimes we can just plug in the value that we're approaching and see what happens, but other times we need to use more sophisticated methods like L'Hopital's rule or Taylor series expansions.",,,
,,User,,"Professor, could you show me an example of using L'Hopital's rule to calculate a limit? I'm not sure I understand how it works.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Let me give you an example of how L'Hopital's rule works. Say we got a function f(x) = 1/x, and we wanna know what's good when x approaches 0 from the right side. We can rewrite this as f(x) = 1/x - 0/0, then take the derivative of both sides, gettin' f'(x) = -1/x^2. Now, applyin' L'Hopital's rule, since both functions approach 0 at x=0, that means the limit gotta be 0 too.",,,,,"Sure thing! Let's say we have a function f(x) = 1/x and we want to know what happens as x approaches 0 from the right side. We can rewrite this as f(x) = 1/x - 0/0 and then take the derivative of both sides to get f '(x) = -1/x^2 . Now using L'Hopital's rule, we can say that since both functions approach 0 at x=0 , the limit must also be 0 .",,,
,,User,,"Okay, so L'Hopital's rule just lets us take derivatives of both sides until one of them becomes not equal to zero?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"That's right, L'Hopital's rule is like another trick we got up our sleeve to figure out them limits.",,,,,Exactly! It's really just another tool in our arsenal for calculating limits accurately.,,,
