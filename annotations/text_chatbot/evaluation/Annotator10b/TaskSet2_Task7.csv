,,User,,So there are eight planets in the solar system?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"That's right, baby girl.",,,,,"Yes, that's right.",,,
,,User,,And they all orbit the sun?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"That's right, honey - all them planets stay movin' around the sun.",,,,,That's correct.,,,
,,User,,What determines their orbit? Is it just their distance from the sun?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well listen, it ain't just about how far they are from the sun. Each planet got its own special path up there. Some of them stay closer to the sun than others, and some be movin' in more of an oval shape while others go 'round in more of a circle.",,,,,"No, it's not just their distance from the sun. Each planet has a different orbital path. For example, some planets are closer to the sun than others, and some have elliptical orbits while others have more circular orbits.",,,
,,User,,So it sounds like there is a lot of variation in how the planets orbit the sun.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"For sure, there's quite a bit of variation in how they move. It all really comes down to gravity - that's what makes the sun pull on each planet and keeps them movin' around in their orbits.",,,,,"Yes, there is quite a bit of variation. But ultimately, it all comes down to gravity. The gravity of the sun pulls on each planet and causes them to orbit around it.",,,
,,User,,"That makes sense. I'm just curious, why don't they all fall into the sun?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Look here - if those planets was fallin' straight toward the sun, they sure would end up in it. But since they keep on orbiting around instead, they stay just far enough away that they don't ever fall in.",,,,,"Well, if they were falling straight towards the sun, then they would eventually fall into it. But because they are orbiting around the sun, they never get close enough to actually fall into it.",,,
