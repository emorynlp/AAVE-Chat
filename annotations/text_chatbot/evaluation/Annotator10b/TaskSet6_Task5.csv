,,User,,"OK, what are my options?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Aight, so if it's a fracture, we either gon' throw a cast on it or gotta do surgery, plain n' simple.",,,,,"Well, if it is a fracture, we can either put a cast on it or do surgery.",,,
,,User,,What's the difference?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,A cast gon' keep yo leg still so it can heal up right. Surgery? That mean they puttin' metal rods or plates in yo leg to hold dem bones steady while they fixin' theyself.,,,,,A cast would immobilize your leg so that it can heal properly.

,,User,,Is one better than the other?,,,,,,,,

But if it's one o' them messy breaks, they prolly gon' hafta go wit surgery.",,,,,"It really depends on the severity of the fracture. If it's a simple break, then a cast should be fine. But if it's a more complex break, then surgery might be necessary.",,,
,,User,,"OK, so let's say I choose surgery. What happens next?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Aight, so they gon' do a operation, slide some metal rods or plates up in yo leg, keep dem bones locked tight while they mendin' up. You lookin' at 'bout 6-8 weeks fo' recovery, give or take.",,,,,We would do an operation to insert metal rods or plates into your leg to hold the bones together while they heal. Recovery time is usually around 6-8 weeks.,,,
,,User,,And if I choose a cast?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Aight, we gon' slap a plaster or fiberglass cast on yo leg, keep it still so it heal up right. You lookin' at 'bout 4-6 weeks fo' recovery, give or take.",,,,,We would put a plaster or fiberglass cast on your leg that would immobilize it so that it can heal properly.
