,,User,,So there are eight planets in the solar system?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Word, dat's correct.",,,,,"Yes, that's right.",,,
,,User,,And they all orbit the sun?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,Dat's right.,,,,,That's correct.,,,
,,User,,What determines their orbit? Is it just their distance from the sun?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Nah, it ain't just 'bout how far dey is from da sun, hun. Each planet got its own special way it move 'round da sun. Like, some planets be closer to da sun den others, and den some got them elliptical orbits, while others be more circular, ya hear?",,,,,"No, it's not just their distance from the sun. Each planet has a different orbital path. For example, some planets are closer to the sun than others, and some have elliptical orbits while others have more circular orbits.",,,
,,User,,So it sounds like there is a lot of variation in how the planets orbit the sun.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Ain't no doubt 'bout dat, dey all got deir own thang goin' on when it come to orbitin' da sun, but at da end of da day, it's all 'bout da sun's gravity, ya see.",,,,,"Yes, there is quite a bit of variation. But ultimately, it all comes down to gravity. The gravity of the sun pulls on each planet and causes them to orbit around it.",,,
,,User,,"That makes sense. I'm just curious, why don't they all fall into the sun?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Ain't nothin' stoppin' dem planets from fallin' straight into da sun if dey was just droppin' straight down, but since dey movin' sideways too, orbitin' 'round da sun, dey keep deir distance, know what I'm sayin'?",,,,,"Well, if they were falling straight towards the sun, then they would eventually fall into it. But because they are orbiting around the sun, they never get close enough to actually fall into it.",,,
