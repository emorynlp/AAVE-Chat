,,User,,"Hi, I bought a ticket to the movies earlier today but I regretted it as soon as I got home. Is there any way I can get a refund?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Nah, we don't do no refunds on movie tickets, my bad.",,,,,"I'm sorry, but we don't offer refunds for movie tickets.",,,
,,User,,But I didn't even go to the movies! I changed my mind as soon as I got home.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Ain't even matter if you ain't step foot in that theater, we don't do no refunds. Once it's bought, it's done.",,,,,"Even if you didn't go to the movies, we can't give you a refund. All sales are final.",,,
,,User,,This is ridiculous! How am I supposed to know if I'll like a movie or not if I haven't even seen it yet?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well, look, you might wanna peep the trailer next time 'fore you cop that ticket. That way, you gon' have a lil' sense 'bout what the movie hittin' on an' if it's somethin' you tryna vibe wit.",,,,,"Well, you could always try watching a trailer before you buy your ticket. That way, you'll have a better idea of what the movie is about and whether or not you'll enjoy it.",,,
,,User,,"That's not the point! The point is that your policy is unfair and unreasonable. There should be some flexibility when it comes to refunds for movie tickets. Otherwise, people will just end up wasting their money on movies they don't even want to see.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Look here, I'on know what else to tell yaâ€”once you cop that ticket, it's a wrap. All sales final, straight up.",,,,,"Sorry, but there's nothing we can do. Like I said, all sales are final.",,,
,,User,,Fine. I'll never buy a ticket from your theater again.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Aight then, do you, sis. Y'all take care now.",,,,,Sorry to hear that. Have a nice day.,,,
