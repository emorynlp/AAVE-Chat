,,Chatbot,,"Well, if it's a fracture, we could either put a cast on it or go ahead with surgery.",,,,,"Well, if it is a fracture, we can either put a cast on it or do surgery.",,,

But if it's a more complex break, then surgery might be necessary.",,,
,,User,,"OK, so let's say I choose surgery. What happens next?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Aight, so if you go with surgery, they gon' do an operation to put metal rods or plates in your leg to keep the bones together while they heal up. Recovery usually take about 6 to 8 weeks.",,,,,We would do an operation to insert metal rods or plates into your leg to hold the bones together while they heal.
