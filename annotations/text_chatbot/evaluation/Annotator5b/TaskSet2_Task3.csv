,,User,,"Well, lately my job has been really stressful and my personal life is in a bit of a transition right now too. So, I think it's just a combination of things that have been making me feel this way.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"I hear ya, it sounds like you got a whole lotta stress weighin' on ya right now.

It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now and your stress levels are very high. Unfortunately, when we're under a lot of stress, our bodies can react in different ways that can make us feel even more anxious and stressed out. For example, we might start to experience headaches or stomach problems because our bodies are so tense all the time. Do you experience any physical symptoms along with your anxiety?",,,
,,User,,"Yes, sometimes I get headaches and my stomach feels upset too. But lately, it seems like my anxiety is mostly mental; it's hard to focus on anything or even enjoy things that used to make me happy because my mind is always occupied with anxious thoughts..",,,,,,,,

First, we could start with some lifestyle changes, like increasing your exercise and relaxation techniques. Additionally, we could also look into some medication options to help reduce your anxiety symptoms. Have you ever tried medication for your anxiety before?",,,
,,User,,"No, I haven't. I'm open to it though if you think it could help me.",,,,,,,,
