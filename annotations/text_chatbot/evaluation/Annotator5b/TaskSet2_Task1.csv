It sounds like you're dealing with a lot right now and your stress levels are very high. Unfortunately, when we're under a lot of stress, our bodies can react in different ways that can make us feel even more anxious and stressed out. For example, we might start to experience headaches or stomach problems because our bodies are so tense all the time. Do you experience any physical symptoms along with your anxiety?",,,
,,User,,"Yes, sometimes I get headaches and my stomach feels upset too. But lately, it seems like my anxiety is mostly mental; it's hard to focus on anything or even enjoy things that used to make me happy because my mind is always occupied with anxious thoughts..",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Ain't nothin' easy 'bout goin' thru dat, fo sho. But on da bright side, dey's treatments out here dat can help calm ya anxiety down some, and get ya feelin' better in ya mind and body, too.",,,,,"That definitely sounds difficult to deal with!
