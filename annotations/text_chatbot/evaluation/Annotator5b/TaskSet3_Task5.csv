,,User,,Alzheimer's? But I'm only in my 60s. Isn't that a disease for old people?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Now, I know what you're thinkin', Alzheimer's is somethin' that happens to folks a lot older than you, but that ain't always the case.

,,User,,So what can I do? Is there a cure?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Now, let me break it down for ya. Ain't no magic fix for dementia, 'cause it's a disease that's gonna keep gettin' worse as time goes on.

Treatment options include medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes.",,,
,,User,,What kind of medication is there?,,,,,,,,

,,User,,And what about therapy? What does that involve?,,,,,,,,
