,,User,,Because it just feels good to be liked by lots of people. It makes me feel important and like I matter.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,Lemme keep it real witchu - is all dem likes really makin you feel good inside? Or is you just frontin to make other folks think you somebody you ain't?,,,,,But does it really make you happy? Or are you just putting on a facade to try and fit in?,,,
,,User,,I don't know. I guess I just want people to like me for who I am.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Look here sugar, you really think all dat popularity gon' make folks see the real you? Cuz I ain't too sure bout dat.",,,,,And you think being popular will help with that?,,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I guess so. If people see that lots of other people like me, then they'll be more likely to like me too.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,Listen here - what if dem folks ain't really feelin' you fa who you is? What if dey just usin' yo name to boost they own clout n' stuff?,,,,,But what if they don't actually like you for who you are? What if they're just using you to try and boost their own popularity?,,,
,,User,,I don't know. I guess that would hurt pretty badly.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Shoot, sound like it ain't even worth all dat trouble den, if you gon' end up gettin' yo feelings hurt in da long run.",,,,,"So maybe it's not worth it then, if there's a chance you could end up getting hurt in the process.",,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I guess you're right. It's just really hard sometimes when it feels like everyone else is having fun and you're not part of it.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Mmhmm, I feel you deep in my soul. But peep dis tho - 'stead of tryna force yo way into dat popular crew, why don't you find yo own people who gon' rock wit you fa real? Dat way, you always gon' have dem real ones in yo corner, no matta what dem other folks at school be doin'.",,,,,"Yeah, I know how that feels. But maybe instead of trying to force your way into the popular crowd, you could find your own group of friends who accept you for who you are. That way, you'll always have a supportive group around you, no matter what happens with the popular kids at school",,,
