,,User,,It's math. I'm having a lot of trouble understanding it and I'm really worried about the test next week.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Let's break it down, see where you're gettin' stuck.",,,,,Let's take a look at what you're struggling with. Maybe we can figure out a way to help you understand it better.,,,
,,User,,"Okay. So, like, this equation here... I don't get how to solve it. And then when we did word problems in class yesterday, I couldn't do any of them.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Aight, lemme take a look at that equation with you. Can you tell me what them variables represent?",,,,,"Okay, well let's start with the equation. Do you know what each variable stands for?",,,
,,User,,"Uh... no, not really.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Now that we got that cleared up, let's begin with what them variables mean, 'kay?",,,,,"All right, let's start there then. Once you know what each variable represents, it might be easier to see how to solve the equation",,,
,,User,,"Okay, that makes sense.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Now that we got that cleared up, let's start by figuring out what x represents in this equation, sound good?",,,,,"So, what do you think x stands for in this equation?",,,
,,User,,I'm not sure... maybe the answer?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"That's a good guess, but in this equation, x represents the number of days it'll take to complete a task. So if we plug in 5 for x, that means it'll take 5 days to complete the task, right?",,,,,"That's a good guess. But in this equation, x represents the number of days it will take to complete a task. So if we plug in 5 for x, that means it will take 5 days to complete the task. Make sense?",,,
