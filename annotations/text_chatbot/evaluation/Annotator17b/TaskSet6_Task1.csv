,,User,,Because it just feels good to be liked by lots of people. It makes me feel important and like I matter.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"But for real doe, is dat really bringin' ya joy, or is ya just frontin' to fit in wit' da crowd?",,,,,But does it really make you happy? Or are you just putting on a facade to try and fit in?,,,
,,User,,I don't know. I guess I just want people to like me for who I am.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"It seem like ya think bein' popular gon' make it easier fo' folks to accept ya fo' who ya is, huh?",,,,,And you think being popular will help with that?,,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I guess so. If people see that lots of other people like me, then they'll be more likely to like me too.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"But hold up, what if dey ain't really feelin' ya fo' who ya is, an' dey just usin' ya to get they own popularity up, huh?",,,,,But what if they don't actually like you for who you are? What if they're just using you to try and boost their own popularity?,,,
,,User,,I don't know. I guess that would hurt pretty badly.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Den maybe it ain't worth da risk, 'specially if ya might end up gettin' hurt in da long run.",,,,,"So maybe it's not worth it then, if there's a chance you could end up getting hurt in the process.",,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I guess you're right. It's just really hard sometimes when it feels like everyone else is having fun and you're not part of it.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Ain't nothin' wrong wit' findin' yo' own crew, ya hear? Dey might not be da most popular, but dey'll be da ones who got yo' back fo' real, an' dat's what truly matter.",,,,,"Yeah, I know how that feels. But maybe instead of trying to force your way into the popular crowd, you could find your own group of friends who accept you for who you are. That way, you'll always have a supportive group around you, no matter what happens with the popular kids at school",,,
