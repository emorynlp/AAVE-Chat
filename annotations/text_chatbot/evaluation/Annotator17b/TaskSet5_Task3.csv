,,User,,It's math. I'm having a lot of trouble understanding it and I'm really worried about the test next week.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Aight, let's see what's givin' you trouble. We can work through it and find a way to make it click for you.",,,,,Let's take a look at what you're struggling with. Maybe we can figure out a way to help you understand it better.,,,
,,User,,"Okay. So, like, this equation here... I don't get how to solve it. And then when we did word problems in class yesterday, I couldn't do any of them.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Alright then, let's start with the equation. Do you understand what each variable means?",,,,,"Okay, well let's start with the equation. Do you know what each variable stands for?",,,
,,User,,"Uh... no, not really.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Okay, let's break it down from there. Once you get what each variable stand for, it might make solving the equation a whole lot clearer.",,,,,"All right, let's start there then. Once you know what each variable represents, it might be easier to see how to solve the equation",,,
,,User,,"Okay, that makes sense.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"So, what you think x might be representin' in this equation?",,,,,"So, what do you think x stands for in this equation?",,,
,,User,,I'm not sure... maybe the answer?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Mm-hmm, that's a solid guess. But in this equation, x is standin' for the number of days it'll take to finish a task. So, if we put 5 in place of x, that means it's gonna take 5 days to get it done. That clear?",,,,,"That's a good guess. But in this equation, x represents the number of days it will take to complete a task. So if we plug in 5 for x, that means it will take 5 days to complete the task. Make sense?",,,
