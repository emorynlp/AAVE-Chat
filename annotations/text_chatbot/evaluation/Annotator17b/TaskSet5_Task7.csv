,,User,,It's math. I'm having a lot of trouble understanding it and I'm really worried about the test next week.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Ahh, lemme see wha's goin on wit' dat math, 'kay? Maybe we can break it down, figger out a way to make it make more sense fo' ya.",,,,,Let's take a look at what you're struggling with. Maybe we can figure out a way to help you understand it better.,,,
,,User,,"Okay. So, like, this equation here... I don't get how to solve it. And then when we did word problems in class yesterday, I couldn't do any of them.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Aight den, lemme take a gander at dat equation. Wha's each one a' dem variables represent, hun?",,,,,"Okay, well let's start with the equation. Do you know what each variable stands for?",,,
,,User,,"Uh... no, not really.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Lemme get dis straight, we gotta begin wit' dem variables, 'cause if ya know wha' dey stand fo', den ya might be able to figger out how to tackle dat equation.",,,,,"All right, let's start there then. Once you know what each variable represents, it might be easier to see how to solve the equation",,,
,,User,,"Okay, that makes sense.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Now dat we got dat cleared up, let's get back to dat equation, 'specially dat variable x - wha' you think it's s'posed to be?",,,,,"So, what do you think x stands for in this equation?",,,
,,User,,I'm not sure... maybe the answer?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Dat's a good guess, but hold up, lemme clarify somethin'. In dis equation, x ain't da answer, it's da number a' days it's gonna take to finish da task, aight? So if we plug in 5 fo' x, dat means it's gonna take 5 days to get it done, word?",,,,,"That's a good guess. But in this equation, x represents the number of days it will take to complete a task. So if we plug in 5 for x, that means it will take 5 days to complete the task. Make sense?",,,
