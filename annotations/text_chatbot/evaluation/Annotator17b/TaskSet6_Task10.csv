,,User,,Because it just feels good to be liked by lots of people. It makes me feel important and like I matter.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Look here, I understand wanting to feel special, but is that really making you happy inside? Or you just putting on a show trying to fit in with everybody else?",,,,,But does it really make you happy? Or are you just putting on a facade to try and fit in?,,,
,,User,,I don't know. I guess I just want people to like me for who I am.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Listen, I get what you're saying, but you really think being popular is gonna make folks like you for who you are?",,,,,And you think being popular will help with that?,,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I guess so. If people see that lots of other people like me, then they'll be more likely to like me too.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"I hear what you're saying, but let me ask you something - what if these folks ain't really feeling you for who you truly are? What if they just trying to ride your wave to boost their own status?",,,,,But what if they don't actually like you for who you are? What if they're just using you to try and boost their own popularity?,,,
,,User,,I don't know. I guess that would hurt pretty badly.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well baby, that's something to think about - might not be worth putting yourself through all that if you could end up getting hurt in the process.",,,,,"So maybe it's not worth it then, if there's a chance you could end up getting hurt in the process.",,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I guess you're right. It's just really hard sometimes when it feels like everyone else is having fun and you're not part of it.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Listen here, I understand that feeling of being left out. But instead of trying to force yourself into that popular crowd, why don't you focus on finding folks who gonna appreciate you for who you really are? That way, you'll have people who got your back, no matter what's going on with them other kids at school.",,,,,"Yeah, I know how that feels. But maybe instead of trying to force your way into the popular crowd, you could find your own group of friends who accept you for who you are. That way, you'll always have a supportive group around you, no matter what happens with the popular kids at school",,,
