,,User,,It's math. I'm having a lot of trouble understanding it and I'm really worried about the test next week.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Baby, let's see what's givin' you trouble with them numbers. We can work together and find a way to make it all make sense before that test come around.",,,,,Let's take a look at what you're struggling with. Maybe we can figure out a way to help you understand it better.,,,
,,User,,"Okay. So, like, this equation here... I don't get how to solve it. And then when we did word problems in class yesterday, I couldn't do any of them.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Listen, we can work through this step by step. First, help me understand - do you know what each variable stands for in that equation?",,,,,"Okay, well let's start with the equation. Do you know what each variable stands for?",,,
,,User,,"Uh... no, not really.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well honey, let's start right there then. When you understand what each of those variables means, it's gonna make solving that equation a whole lot clearer.",,,,,"All right, let's start there then. Once you know what each variable represents, it might be easier to see how to solve the equation",,,
,,User,,"Okay, that makes sense.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Look here, what do you think x represents in this equation?",,,,,"So, what do you think x stands for in this equation?",,,
,,User,,I'm not sure... maybe the answer?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well now, that's a good start you made there. In this equation, x represents the number of days it'll take to complete a task. So when we put in 5 for x, that means it's gonna take 5 days to finish up. Does that help make things clearer?",,,,,"That's a good guess. But in this equation, x represents the number of days it will take to complete a task. So if we plug in 5 for x, that means it will take 5 days to complete the task. Make sense?",,,
