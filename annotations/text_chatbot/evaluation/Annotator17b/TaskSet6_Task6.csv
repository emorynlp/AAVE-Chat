,,User,,Because it just feels good to be liked by lots of people. It makes me feel important and like I matter.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Look here, is all that attention really makin' you happy inside? Or you just puttin' on a show tryna fit in with everybody else?",,,,,But does it really make you happy? Or are you just putting on a facade to try and fit in?,,,
,,User,,I don't know. I guess I just want people to like me for who I am.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Baby girl, let me tell you somethin' - you really think all that popularity gon' make folks see the real you?",,,,,And you think being popular will help with that?,,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I guess so. If people see that lots of other people like me, then they'll be more likely to like me too.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Listen, what if they ain't really feelin' you for who you are though? What if they just usin' you to try and boost they own popularity?",,,,,But what if they don't actually like you for who you are? What if they're just using you to try and boost their own popularity?,,,
,,User,,I don't know. I guess that would hurt pretty badly.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Baby, that's what I'm sayin' - if you might end up gettin' hurt in the process, then maybe all this ain't even worth your time and energy.",,,,,"So maybe it's not worth it then, if there's a chance you could end up getting hurt in the process.",,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I guess you're right. It's just really hard sometimes when it feels like everyone else is having fun and you're not part of it.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"I feel you on that one, sugar. But instead of chasin' after them popular folks, why don't you focus on findin' your own circle - people who gon' appreciate the real you? That way, you'll have some true friends in your corner, regardless of what them other kids at school be doin'.",,,,,"Yeah, I know how that feels. But maybe instead of trying to force your way into the popular crowd, you could find your own group of friends who accept you for who you are. That way, you'll always have a supportive group around you, no matter what happens with the popular kids at school",,,
