,,User,,It's math. I'm having a lot of trouble understanding it and I'm really worried about the test next week.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,Let's go over what's giving you trouble. We'll see if we can find a way to make it click for you.,,,,,Let's take a look at what you're struggling with. Maybe we can figure out a way to help you understand it better.,,,
,,User,,"Okay. So, like, this equation here... I don't get how to solve it. And then when we did word problems in class yesterday, I couldn't do any of them.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Alright, let's tackle the equation first. Can you tell me what each variable represents?",,,,,"Okay, well let's start with the equation. Do you know what each variable stands for?",,,
,,User,,"Uh... no, not really.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Okay, let's start with that. Figuring out what each variable stands for might make solving the equation a bit clearer.",,,,,"All right, let's start there then. Once you know what each variable represents, it might be easier to see how to solve the equation",,,
,,User,,"Okay, that makes sense.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Alright, let's start with thisâ€”what do you think x represents in the equation?",,,,,"So, what do you think x stands for in this equation?",,,
,,User,,I'm not sure... maybe the answer?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"That's a solid guess. In this case, though, x stands for the number of days it'll take to finish the task. So, if we put 5 in for x, it means the task would take 5 days to complete. Does that make sense?",,,,,"That's a good guess. But in this equation, x represents the number of days it will take to complete a task. So if we plug in 5 for x, that means it will take 5 days to complete the task. Make sense?",,,
