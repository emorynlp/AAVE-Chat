,,User,,"It's been working pretty well, but I'm not sure if it's worth the side effects.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,What kind of side effects have you been dealing with?,,,,,What side effects have you been experiencing?,,,
,,User,,Mostly just fatigue and some nausea. But the fatigue is really starting to interfere with my daily life.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,That makes sense. Have you had a chance to bring it up with your prescriber? Sometimes adjusting the dose or how often you take it can make a difference with side effects like fatigue.,,,,,That is a valid concern. Have you talked to your prescriber about changing the dose or frequency of your medication? Because sometimes that can help with side effects like fatigue.,,,
,,User,,"Yeah, we've tried a few different things but nothing has really helped too much. So I was thinking maybe it would be best to just go off of the medication altogether and try natural remedies instead.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Alright, so let me ask you thisâ€”have you looked into any natural remedies that could help with your condition?",,,,,"Okay, well let me ask you this then- have you done any research on natural remedies that might help with your condition?",,,
,,User,,"Yeah, actually I have been doing a lot of research lately and there are a few things that seem promising.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,That's awesome! What kinds of things are you thinking about trying?,,,,,That's great! What are some of the things you're considering trying?,,,
,,User,,"Well, one thing I've read about is vitamin B12 shots- apparently they can be really helpful for energy levels. And another thing is omega-3 supplements- they supposedly help with inflammation which is part of what my condition is caused by.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Those both sound like solid options to look into! Before you make any big changes, though, it'd be a good idea to set up a chat with your doctor. They'll probably have a better sense of whether stopping your medication is the right move for your situation.",,,,,"Those both sound like reasonable options to explore further! But before making any decisions, I think it would be wise to schedule an appointment with your prescribing doctor so that he or she can weigh in on this as well. They will likely have more insight into whether or not going off your medication is the best option for you based on your specific situation.",,,
