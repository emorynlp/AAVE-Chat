,,User,,What do they mean?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Aight, lemme break it down fo' ya. That first word, ""abandon,"" it mean leavin' somethin' or somebody behind, like straight up ditchin' 'em. Like, if you abandon yo' car in the street, you leavin' it there an' ain't comin' back fo' it, nahmean?",,,,,"Well, let's see. The first word is ""abandon.""

,,User,,"Okay, I got it. What's the next one?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Aight, so the next word we got is ""reluctant."" That mean you ain't tryna do somethin' or you feelin' some kinda way 'bout doin' it. Like, if it's rainin' an' you reluctant to step out, that's 'cause you don't wanna get all soaked up, ya feel?",,,,,"The next word is ""reluctant."" It means being unwilling to do something or feeling hesitant about doing something.

,,Chatbot,,"Aight, so the next one we got is ""cease."" That mean to stop doin' somethin' or bring it to an end.

,,User,,"Okay, I understand that one too. What about the last two words?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Aight, so that fourth word right there is ""devastate."" That mean to mess somethin' up real bad, like cause hella damage or wreck somethin' completely.

That mean to be strugglin' or sufferin', like you stuck somewhere, bored out ya mind or just feelin' straight up neglected. Like, a prisoner might languish in jail, sittin' there all day wit' nothin' to do an' nobody comin' to see 'em, ya feel?",,,,,"The fourth word on the list is ""devastate."" Devastate means to cause great damage or destruction. For example, a fire can devastate a city by destroying many buildings and homes. And the last word on the list is ""languish."" Languish means to suffer from boredom or neglect. For example, a prisoner might languish in jail because he's not getting any visitors and he's bored out of his mind with nothing to do all day long",,,
