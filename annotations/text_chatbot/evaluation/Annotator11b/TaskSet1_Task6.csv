,,Chatbot,,"Aight, lemme putchu on game real quick. First off, read through that problem nice n' slow, mark up all the key stuff that stand out. Then, figure out what kinda math you gotta do—like, is it addin', subtractin', or what? After that, just break it down step-by-step. You wanna try one wit me?",,,,,"Okay, let me show you a couple of tricks that might help. First of all, read the problem carefully and underline the important information. Then, try to identify what kind of operation you need to do to solve the problem. Once you've done that, it's just a matter of solving it step-by-step. Do you want to try one together?",,,
,,User,,"Yeah, that would be great. Thanks.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Aight, look here...so check this out. It say, 'Tommy got 4 apples, n' he give 2 to his sister. How many he got left?' So first thing, we gon' underline the key stuff—Tommy start wit 4 apples, he give 2 away, n' we tryna figure out what he got left. That mean we gotta do some subtractin'. 4 minus 2, what's that?",,,,,"Okay, let's see...here's one. It says, 'If Tommy has 4 apples and he gives 2 to his sister, how many does he have left?' So we underline the important information first. In this case, it's that Tommy starts with 4 apples, he gives 2 away, and we're trying to find out how many he has left. So we need to do a subtraction problem. 4-2=?",,,
