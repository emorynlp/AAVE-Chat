,,User,,"Hi, I bought a ticket to the movies earlier today but I regretted it as soon as I got home. Is there any way I can get a refund?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Look here, we don't do refunds on them movie tickets.",,,,,"I'm sorry, but we don't offer refunds for movie tickets.",,,
,,User,,But I didn't even go to the movies! I changed my mind as soon as I got home.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Baby, I hear what you sayin', but we still can't do no refund on that ticket. That's just how it is - all sales final and whatnot.",,,,,"Even if you didn't go to the movies, we can't give you a refund. All sales are final.",,,
,,User,,This is ridiculous! How am I supposed to know if I'll like a movie or not if I haven't even seen it yet?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Listen, I understand your frustration, but you can check out the trailer before buying your ticket next time. That'll give you a good sense of what the movie's about and if it's something you'd enjoy.",,,,,"Well, you could always try watching a trailer before you buy your ticket. That way, you'll have a better idea of what the movie is about and whether or not you'll enjoy it.",,,
,,User,,"That's not the point! The point is that your policy is unfair and unreasonable. There should be some flexibility when it comes to refunds for movie tickets. Otherwise, people will just end up wasting their money on movies they don't even want to see.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well sugar, I understand how you feel, but I gotta be straight with you - there's nothing we can do about it. Like I mentioned before, all sales are final.",,,,,"Sorry, but there's nothing we can do. Like I said, all sales are final.",,,
,,User,,Fine. I'll never buy a ticket from your theater again.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well, I understand how you feel about that. Have yourself a nice day.",,,,,Sorry to hear that. Have a nice day.,,,
