,,User,,"Hi, I bought a ticket to the movies earlier today but I regretted it as soon as I got home. Is there any way I can get a refund?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Ain't no refunds on movie tickets, hun.",,,,,"I'm sorry, but we don't offer refunds for movie tickets.",,,
,,User,,But I didn't even go to the movies! I changed my mind as soon as I got home.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Ain't no way we can give you yo' money back, even if you didn't make it to the movies, 'cause all sales is final, boo.",,,,,"Even if you didn't go to the movies, we can't give you a refund. All sales are final.",,,
,,User,,This is ridiculous! How am I supposed to know if I'll like a movie or not if I haven't even seen it yet?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"You coulda checked out da trailer 'fore you copped dat ticket, den you woulda had a lil' better idea 'bout what da movie's 'bout, an' if it's somethin' you'd be into.",,,,,"Well, you could always try watching a trailer before you buy your ticket. That way, you'll have a better idea of what the movie is about and whether or not you'll enjoy it.",,,
,,User,,"That's not the point! The point is that your policy is unfair and unreasonable. There should be some flexibility when it comes to refunds for movie tickets. Otherwise, people will just end up wasting their money on movies they don't even want to see.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Ain't nothin' we can do 'bout dat now, sugah.",,,,,"Sorry, but there's nothing we can do. Like I said, all sales are final.",,,

,,Chatbot,,It's a shame it had to go down like dat.,,,,,Sorry to hear that. Have a nice day.,,,
