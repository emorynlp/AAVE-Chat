,,User,,"Hey, do you have a minute? I've been working on this project for a while, but I'm stuck.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Sure thing, what's going on?",,,,,"Of course, what's up?",,,
,,User,,I can't seem to find the information I need to complete my project. Do you know where I could look?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Alright, let me check it out. What specifically are you trying to find?",,,,,Let me take a look. What exactly are you looking for?,,,
,,User,,"Well, I need to find out more about the history of the civil rights movement. But all the sources I've found so far only give me a brief overview. I was hoping to find something that would go into more detail.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Hmm, that's a tough one. Have you thought about checking out the library? They might have some detailed books that could help.",,,,,"Hmm, that is tricky. Have you tried the library? They might have some books that would be helpful.",,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I've been there already. But they only had a few books and most of them were checked out already.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well, you might want to try searching online instead. There's got to be some websites out there with more in-depth information than what the library had.",,,,,"Well, you could try looking online then. There are bound to be some websites that have more information than the books at the library.",,,
,,User,,"Yeah, but so far everything I've found is really surface level stuff. It's not what I'm looking for.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well, how about narrowing down your search a bit? Instead of just looking up ""civil rights movement,"" try using more specific terms like ""freedom riders"" or ""desegregation."" That might help you find something more detailed and closer to what you need.",,,,,"Well, maybe try narrowing your search criteria then? Instead of just searching for ""civil rights movement,"" try adding in specific keywords like ""freedom riders"" or ""desegregation."" That way you'll get results that are more relevant to what you're looking for.",,,
