We can definitely get you a cane to help with your mobility. Let's go over a few things first, though. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?",,,
,,User,,"Oh, it's been going on for a little while now. Maybe a couple of months or so?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Aww shoo, lemme get a better picture 'bout what's goin' on wit' ya. You havin' a lil' trouble or a whole lotta trouble when it come to walkin'?",,,,,"Okay. And how much difficulty are you having when walking? Are you able to walk short distances without too much trouble, or is it more difficult than that?",,,

,,Chatbot,,"A'ight, so it sound like ya might be dealin' wit' some kinda muscular weakness, ya hear? Now, I'ma need ya to think 'bout if ya noticed any other changes in ya body dat might be connected to dis. Like, ya weight been doin' any funny business lately?",,,,,"Alright. That sounds like you may be experiencing some muscular weakness then. Have you noticed any other changes in your body that might be related to this? For example, has your weight changed at all recently?",,,
,,User,,"Now that you mention it, I have lost a few pounds recently. I'm not sure if that's related though.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"It's possible, den. Losin' weight like dat could be a sign of somethin' else goin' on wit' ya body. You been feelin' tired a lot, or ya energy levels been actin' funny lately?",,,,,It could be. Weight loss can sometimes be a sign of an underlying health condition. Have you been feeling fatigued or having any other changes in your energy levels?,,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I've been really tired lately. It's hard to get out of bed in the morning, and I just don't have the energy to do much during the day.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"A'ight, so all dem symptoms ya mentioned, dey could be signs of somethin' else goin' on wit' ya body, too. We gon' need to do some more testin' to figger out what's good, but fo' now, we can def get ya set up wit' dat cane to help ya get 'round better.",,,,,"Okay, those are all potential symptoms of an underlying health condition as well. We'll need to do some further testing to see what might be going on. In the meantime, though, we'll go ahead and get you a cane to help with your mobility.",,,
