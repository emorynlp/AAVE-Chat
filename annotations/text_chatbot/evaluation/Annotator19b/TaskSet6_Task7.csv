,,User,,"Hi, Doctor. I'm having some trouble walking. My legs feel heavy and unsteady, so I was wondering if I could get a cane to help me out.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"For sho'. We can def get you set up wit' a cane to help wit' gettin' around. Now, lemme ask, how long you been dealin' wit' these symptoms, hun?",,,,,"Absolutely. We can definitely get you a cane to help with your mobility. Let's go over a few things first, though. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?",,,
,,User,,"Oh, it's been going on for a little while now. Maybe a couple of months or so?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Aight, lemme get a lil' more info 'bout what's goin' on. You havin' trouble walkin' them short distances, or is it more like you can't even take a few steps wit'out strugglin'?",,,,,"Okay. And how much difficulty are you having when walking? Are you able to walk short distances without too much trouble, or is it more difficult than that?",,,
,,User,,"Well, short distances are still okay, but anything further than that is really tough. I start feeling really tired and my legs just don't want to cooperate anymore.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Now dat we got dat established, it sounds like you might be dealin' wit' some kinda muscular weakness. You noticed any other changes in ya body dat could be connected to dis, like maybe a change in weight or somethin'?",,,,,"Alright. That sounds like you may be experiencing some muscular weakness then. Have you noticed any other changes in your body that might be related to this? For example, has your weight changed at all recently?",,,
,,User,,"Now that you mention it, I have lost a few pounds recently. I'm not sure if that's related though.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"It's possible, yeah. Losin' weight can be a sign of somethin' else goin' on wit' ya body. You been feelin' extra tired lately, or noticed any other changes in ya energy levels?",,,,,It could be. Weight loss can sometimes be a sign of an underlying health condition. Have you been feeling fatigued or having any other changes in your energy levels?,,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I've been really tired lately. It's hard to get out of bed in the morning, and I just don't have the energy to do much during the day.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"For sho', we gon' need to do some more testin' to figure out what's goin' on wit' ya body. But in da meantime, we can def get you set up wit' dat cane to help wit' gettin' around, 'kay?",,,,,"Okay, those are all potential symptoms of an underlying health condition as well. We'll need to do some further testing to see what might be going on. In the meantime, though, we'll go ahead and get you a cane to help with your mobility.",,,
