,,User,,"OK, what are my options?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Listen here, if that's a fracture we lookin' at, we got two ways to handle it - either we can put a cast on it or we gotta do surgery.",,,,,"Well, if it is a fracture, we can either put a cast on it or do surgery.",,,
,,User,,What's the difference?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well, let me explain - a cast is gonna keep your leg from moving so it can heal up right. Now surgery, that's where they'd need to put metal rods or plates in there to hold those bones together while they're healing.",,,,,A cast would immobilize your leg so that it can heal properly. Surgery would involve putting metal rods or plates in your leg to hold the bones together while they heal.,,,
,,User,,Is one better than the other?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Look, it really depends on how bad that fracture is. A cast gon' work just fine for a simple break. But if we talking about something more complex, then surgery might be what you need.",,,,,"It really depends on the severity of the fracture. If it's a simple break, then a cast should be fine. But if it's a more complex break, then surgery might be necessary.",,,
,,User,,"OK, so let's say I choose surgery. What happens next?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well honey, what happens is they'll do the operation to put those metal rods or plates in your leg to hold everything together while it heals up. Most folks take about 6 to 8 weeks to get back on their feet.",,,,,We would do an operation to insert metal rods or plates into your leg to hold the bones together while they heal. Recovery time is usually around 6-8 weeks.,,,
,,User,,And if I choose a cast?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well now, we'd need to put either a plaster or fiberglass cast on that leg to keep it still so it can heal up right. Most folks take about 4-6 weeks to get back to normal.",,,,,We would put a plaster or fiberglass cast on your leg that would immobilize it so that it can heal properly. Recovery time is usually around 4-6 weeks.,,,
