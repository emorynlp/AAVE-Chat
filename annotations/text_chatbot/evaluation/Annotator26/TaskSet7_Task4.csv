,,User,,"OK, what are my options?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"If it turns out to be a fracture, we can either go with a cast or consider surgery.",,,,,"Well, if it is a fracture, we can either put a cast on it or do surgery.",,,
,,User,,What's the difference?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"A cast keeps your leg still so it can heal the right way. Surgery, on the other hand, means using metal rods or plates to hold the bones in place while they mend.",,,,,A cast would immobilize your leg so that it can heal properly. Surgery would involve putting metal rods or plates in your leg to hold the bones together while they heal.,,,
,,User,,Is one better than the other?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"It really comes down to how bad the fracture is. If it's a straightforward break, a cast should do the trick. But if the break's more complicated, surgery might be the better option.",,,,,"It really depends on the severity of the fracture. If it's a simple break, then a cast should be fine. But if it's a more complex break, then surgery might be necessary.",,,
,,User,,"OK, so let's say I choose surgery. What happens next?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,We'd perform a surgery to place metal rods or plates in your leg to keep the bones stable while they heal. Recovery typically takes about 6 to 8 weeks.,,,,,We would do an operation to insert metal rods or plates into your leg to hold the bones together while they heal.

,,Chatbot,,We'd put a plaster or fiberglass cast on your leg to keep it still and let it heal the way it's supposed to. Recovery usually takes about 4 to 6 weeks.,,,,,We would put a plaster or fiberglass cast on your leg that would immobilize it so that it can heal properly.
