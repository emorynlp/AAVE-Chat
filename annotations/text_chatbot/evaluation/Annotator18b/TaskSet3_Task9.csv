,,User,,Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Nothin' to it, I gotchu. Alright, so I pulled up yo' account, and it looks like yo' total bill is $120 for the month. You wanna pay that all at once or break it down into payments?",,,,,No problem at all. So it looks like your total bill is $120 for the month. Are you looking to pay that off in full or make payments over time?,,,
,,User,,"If possible, I would like to just make payments over time. My financial situation isn't the best right now and paying it all off at once is going to be a little difficult.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"We can def set up a payment plan that'll work fo' you. How 'bout we break it down to $40 a week fo' three weeks? That way, you'll be all paid up in no time.",,,,,That's no problem at all. We can set up a payment plan for you where you pay $40 per week for three weeks until the bill is paid off in full. Does that sound good?,,,
,,User,,"Yeah, that sounds great actually. Thank you so much for your help with this",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,I got you taken care of now. I'ma go 'head and set up that payment plan for ya. Anything else I can assist you with today?,,,,,No problem at all. I'll go ahead and set that up for you now. Is there anything else I can help you with today?,,,
