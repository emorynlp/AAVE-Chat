,,User,,"Professor, I'm sorry to interrupt, but could you go over the material from last lecture again? I wasn't able to get all of the notes and I want to make sure I understand everything.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"A'ight den, lemme see if I can dig up dem notes from las' lecture. Ah, got 'em right here. Now, where we gon' start at?",,,,,"Of course, Izaac. Let me see if I can find my notes from that lecture. Ah, here they are. Now, where should we start?",,,
,,User,,"Well, could you explain what a limit is again? I didn't quite understand that concept.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"A'ight, lemme break it down fo' ya. A limit be like a way we define a function when it get close to a certain point, ya hear? Like, if we got us a function f(x) dat approach infinity as x go on forever, den we say da limit of f(x) as x go on forever be infinity, word.",,,,,"Sure. A limit is basically just a way of defining a function as it approaches a certain point. For example, if we have a function f(x) that approaches infinity as x goes to infinity, we would say that the limit of f(x) as x goes to infinity is infinity.",,,
,,User,,"Okay, that makes sense. But how do we actually calculate limits?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Ain't but a few ways we go 'bout calculatin' dem limits, dependin' on da kinda function we dealin' wit'. Sometimes we can jus' plug in da value we approachin', see what's good, but other times we gotta bust out da big guns, know what I'm sayin', like L'Hopital's rule or Taylor series expansions.",,,,,"Well, there are a few different ways depending on the function involved. Sometimes we can just plug in the value that we're approaching and see what happens, but other times we need to use more sophisticated methods like L'Hopital's rule or Taylor series expansions.",,,
,,User,,"Professor, could you show me an example of using L'Hopital's rule to calculate a limit? I'm not sure I understand how it works.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Awwite, lemme give ya an example 'bout usin' L'Hopital's rule, 'kay? Say we got us a function f(x) = 1/x, an' we tryna figger out what's good when x approach 0 from da right side, feelin' me? We can rewrite dis as f(x) = 1/x - 0/0, den take da derivative of both sides, an' we get f'(x) = -1/x^2. Now, 'cordin' to L'Hopital's rule, since both dem functions approach 0 at x=0, da limit gotta be 0 too, word.",,,,,"Sure thing! Let's say we have a function f(x) = 1/x and we want to know what happens as x approaches 0 from the right side. We can rewrite this as f(x) = 1/x - 0/0 and then take the derivative of both sides to get f '(x) = -1/x^2 . Now using L'Hopital's rule, we can say that since both functions approach 0 at x=0 , the limit must also be 0 .",,,
,,User,,"Okay, so L'Hopital's rule just lets us take derivatives of both sides until one of them becomes not equal to zero?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Dat's right, L'Hopital's rule jus' give us anotha way to figger out dem limits, 'specially when we dealin' wit' functions dat give us 0/0 or infinity/infinity, 'n' we gotta keep takin' dem derivatives till we get somethin' we can work wit'.",,,,,Exactly! It's really just another tool in our arsenal for calculating limits accurately.,,,
