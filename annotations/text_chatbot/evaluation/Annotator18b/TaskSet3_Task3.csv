,,Chatbot,,"Ain't no thang. So, look like yo bill sittin' at $120 dis month. You tryna knock it out all at once or break it down in payments?",,,,,No problem at all. So it looks like your total bill is $120 for the month. Are you looking to pay that off in full or make payments over time?,,,
,,User,,"If possible, I would like to just make payments over time. My financial situation isn't the best right now and paying it all off at once is going to be a little difficult.",,,,,,,,

,,User,,"Yeah, that sounds great actually. Thank you so much for your help with this",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Ain't no trouble, imma get that set up fo' you right now. Anything else you need me to handle today?",,,,,No problem at all. I'll go ahead and set that up for you now. Is there anything else I can help you with today?,,,
