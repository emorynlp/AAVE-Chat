,,User,,Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well honey, let me tell you what I'm seein' - your total bill's $120 for this month. You wanna handle that all at once or break it down into smaller payments over time?",,,,,No problem at all. So it looks like your total bill is $120 for the month. Are you looking to pay that off in full or make payments over time?,,,
,,User,,"If possible, I would like to just make payments over time. My financial situation isn't the best right now and paying it all off at once is going to be a little difficult.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Look here, that's not a problem at all. We can work it out so you pay $40 per week for three weeks 'til the bill's paid in full. How's that sound to you?",,,,,That's no problem at all. We can set up a payment plan for you where you pay $40 per week for three weeks until the bill is paid off in full. Does that sound good?,,,
,,User,,"Yeah, that sounds great actually. Thank you so much for your help with this",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well, I'ma go ahead and set that up for you right now. Anything else you need help with today?",,,,,No problem at all. I'll go ahead and set that up for you now. Is there anything else I can help you with today?,,,
