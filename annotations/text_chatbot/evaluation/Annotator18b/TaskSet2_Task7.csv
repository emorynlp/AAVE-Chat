,,User,,"Professor, I'm sorry to interrupt, but could you go over the material from last lecture again? I wasn't able to get all of the notes and I want to make sure I understand everything.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Sho nuff, lemme see if I can find dem notes from dat lecture real quick. *shuffling papers* Mmhmm, here dey is. Now where we finna start at?",,,,,"Of course, Izaac. Let me see if I can find my notes from that lecture. Ah, here they are. Now, where should we start?",,,
,,User,,"Well, could you explain what a limit is again? I didn't quite understand that concept.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Look here, a limit be when we tryna figure out what a function gon' do when it get close to a certain spot. Like if we got dis function f(x) dat keep goin' up and up when x get bigger and bigger, den we say dat limit of f(x) as x go to infinity be infinity, ya heard?",,,,,"Sure. A limit is basically just a way of defining a function as it approaches a certain point. For example, if we have a function f(x) that approaches infinity as x goes to infinity, we would say that the limit of f(x) as x goes to infinity is infinity.",,,
,,User,,"Okay, that makes sense. But how do we actually calculate limits?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Listen up sugar, we got a few different ways to work dis out, dependin' on what kinda function we dealin' wit'. Sometimes we can jus' plug in dat number we gettin' close to and see what pop out, but other times we gotta get mo' fancy wit' it - use dem tricks like L'Hopital's rule or dem Taylor series expansions and whatnot.",,,,,"Well, there are a few different ways depending on the function involved. Sometimes we can just plug in the value that we're approaching and see what happens, but other times we need to use more sophisticated methods like L'Hopital's rule or Taylor series expansions.",,,
,,User,,"Professor, could you show me an example of using L'Hopital's rule to calculate a limit? I'm not sure I understand how it works.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Aight now, peep dis right here - let's say we workin' wit' dis function f(x) = 1/x and we tryna figure out what be happenin' when x gettin' real close to 0 from da right side. We can switch it up and write it like f(x) = 1/x - 0/0, den take dem derivatives on both sides to get f'(x) = -1/x^2. Now when we use dat L'Hopital's rule - since both dem functions be headin' to 0 when x hit 0, dat limit gotta be 0 too.",,,,,"Sure thing! Let's say we have a function f(x) = 1/x and we want to know what happens as x approaches 0 from the right side. We can rewrite this as f(x) = 1/x - 0/0 and then take the derivative of both sides to get f '(x) = -1/x^2 . Now using L'Hopital's rule, we can say that since both functions approach 0 at x=0 , the limit must also be 0 .",,,
,,User,,"Okay, so L'Hopital's rule just lets us take derivatives of both sides until one of them becomes not equal to zero?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Yasss hunni, dat's exactly what it is! Ain't nothin' but another tool in our toolbox fo' gettin' dem limits right and tight. When both da top and bottom be givin' us zero, we jus' take dem derivatives til somethin' come out not zero, and dat's all it is to it.",,,,,Exactly! It's really just another tool in our arsenal for calculating limits accurately.,,,
