,,Chatbot,,"I'm doin' alright, thank ya for askin'. Whas good, how 'bout I help ya wit somethin'?",,,,,"I'm doing well, thank you. How can I help you?",,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I was wondering if I could set up a payment plan for my phone bill. I'm a little short on cash this month and I really need to keep my phone service.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"A'ight den, lemme see whas we can do 'bout gettin' you set up wit a payment plan fo' dat phone bill a' yours.",,,,,Absolutely. We can definitely set something up for you. Let me pull up your account information and we'll see what we can do.,,,
,,User,,Thank you so much. I really appreciate it.,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Ain't no thang, hun. Now, let's take a gander at dat bill a' yours - it's lookin' like you owe 'em $120 fo' dis month. You tryna pay dat all at once or break it down into smaller payments?",,,,,No problem at all. So it looks like your total bill is $120 for the month. Are you looking to pay that off in full or make payments over time?,,,
,,User,,"If possible, I would like to just make payments over time. My financial situation isn't the best right now and paying it all off at once is going to be a little difficult.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Dat sounds like a plan we can work wit. We can set it up so you pay $40 a week fo' three weeks, 'n' den dat bill a' yours'll be paid off in full, a'right?",,,,,That's no problem at all. We can set up a payment plan for you where you pay $40 per week for three weeks until the bill is paid off in full. Does that sound good?,,,
,,User,,"Yeah, that sounds great actually. Thank you so much for your help with this",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Ain't nothin' to it, I gotchu. I'ma go 'head 'n' set dat payment plan up fo' ya right now. You need help wit anythin' else today?",,,,,No problem at all. I'll go ahead and set that up for you now. Is there anything else I can help you with today?,,,
