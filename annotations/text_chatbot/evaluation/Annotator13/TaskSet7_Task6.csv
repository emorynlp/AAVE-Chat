,,User,,"Hi, Doctor. I'm having some trouble walking. My legs feel heavy and unsteady, so I was wondering if I could get a cane to help me out.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Aight, we can getchu a cane, no problem. But lemme ask you somethin' real quickâ€”how long you been feelin' like this?",,,,,"Absolutely. We can definitely get you a cane to help with your mobility. Let's go over a few things first, though. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?",,,
,,User,,"Oh, it's been going on for a little while now. Maybe a couple of months or so?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Aight then, so how hard it be when you tryna walk? Like, you still makin' it short ways wit'out too much fuss, or it's gettin' real tough out here?",,,,,"Okay. And how much difficulty are you having when walking? Are you able to walk short distances without too much trouble, or is it more difficult than that?",,,
,,User,,"Well, short distances are still okay, but anything further than that is really tough. I start feeling really tired and my legs just don't want to cooperate anymore.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Aight, sound like you dealin' wit' some muscle weakness or somethin'. You peeped any other changes goin' on wit' yo body? Like, yo weight been switchin' up lately or nah?",,,,,"Alright. That sounds like you may be experiencing some muscular weakness then. Have you noticed any other changes in your body that might be related to this? For example, has your weight changed at all recently?",,,
,,User,,"Now that you mention it, I have lost a few pounds recently. I'm not sure if that's related though.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Mmhmm, that might be tied up in it. Losin' weight like that could mean somethin' else goin' on. You been feelin' wore out or noticin' any shifts in yo energy lately?",,,,,It could be. Weight loss can sometimes be a sign of an underlying health condition. Have you been feeling fatigued or having any other changes in your energy levels?,,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I've been really tired lately. It's hard to get out of bed in the morning, and I just don't have the energy to do much during the day.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Aight, all that sound like it could be tied to somethin' deeper goin' on wit' yo health. We gon' need to run some tests, see what's really poppin'. But for now, we gon' hook you up wit' that cane so movin' 'round ain't so rough on ya.",,,,,"Okay, those are all potential symptoms of an underlying health condition as well. We'll need to do some further testing to see what might be going on. In the meantime, though, we'll go ahead and get you a cane to help with your mobility.",,,
