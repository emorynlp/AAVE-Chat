,,Chatbot,,Lemme see what's up. What kinda info you tryna find?,,,,,Let me take a look. What exactly are you looking for?,,,
,,User,,"Well, I need to find out more about the history of the civil rights movement. But all the sources I've found so far only give me a brief overview. I was hoping to find something that would go into more detail.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Hmm, that do sound tricky. You thought 'bout checkin' the library? They prolly got some books that could help you out.",,,,,"Hmm, that is tricky. Have you tried the library? They might have some books that would be helpful.",,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I've been there already. But they only had a few books and most of them were checked out already.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well, you might wanna try lookin' online. Bet there's some websites out there with more details than what the library got.",,,,,"Well, you could try looking online then. There are bound to be some websites that have more information than the books at the library.",,,
,,User,,"Yeah, but so far everything I've found is really surface level stuff. It's not what I'm looking for.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well, how 'bout you try makin' your search more specific? Instead of just lookin' up ""civil rights movement,"" throw in some keywords like ""freedom riders"" or ""desegregation."" That might help you find somethin' closer to what you need.",,,,,"Well, maybe try narrowing your search criteria then? Instead of just searching for ""civil rights movement,"" try adding in specific keywords like ""freedom riders"" or ""desegregation."" That way you'll get results that are more relevant to what you're looking for.",,,
