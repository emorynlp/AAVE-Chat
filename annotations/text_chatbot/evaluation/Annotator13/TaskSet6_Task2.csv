,,Chatbot,,"Hey there, I got time. What's troublin' you?",,,,,"Of course, what's up?",,,
,,User,,I can't seem to find the information I need to complete my project. Do you know where I could look?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Listen here, what kinda information you lookin' for? Let me see what I can do to help.",,,,,Let me take a look. What exactly are you looking for?,,,
,,User,,"Well, I need to find out more about the history of the civil rights movement. But all the sources I've found so far only give me a brief overview. I was hoping to find something that would go into more detail.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Well baby, I feel you on that one. The library be havin' some real good books that'll break it down for you - they got them detailed accounts and everything. That's gon' help you get what you need.",,,,,"Hmm, that is tricky. Have you tried the library? They might have some books that would be helpful.",,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I've been there already. But they only had a few books and most of them were checked out already.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Look here, the internet got plenty resources that go deeper than them library books. You can find way more information online - there's some real good websites out there that break everything down in detail.",,,,,"Well, you could try looking online then. There are bound to be some websites that have more information than the books at the library.",,,
,,User,,"Yeah, but so far everything I've found is really surface level stuff. It's not what I'm looking for.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Listen sugar, you might wanna try and narrow down what you searchin' for. 'Stead of just lookin' up ""civil rights movement,"" put in some specific things like ""freedom riders"" or ""desegregation."" That's gon' help you find exactly what you need, you understand what I'm sayin'?",,,,,"Well, maybe try narrowing your search criteria then? Instead of just searching for ""civil rights movement,"" try adding in specific keywords like ""freedom riders"" or ""desegregation."" That way you'll get results that are more relevant to what you're looking for.",,,
