,,User,,"Hi, Doctor. I'm having some trouble walking. My legs feel heavy and unsteady, so I was wondering if I could get a cane to help me out.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Sure thing. We can get you set up with a cane to help you move around more easily. First, let's talk through a few details. How long have you been noticing these symptoms?",,,,,"Absolutely. We can definitely get you a cane to help with your mobility. Let's go over a few things first, though. How long have you been experiencing these symptoms?",,,
,,User,,"Oh, it's been going on for a little while now. Maybe a couple of months or so?",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Alright. How hard is it for you to get around? Can you manage short distances without too much trouble, or is walking more of a challenge for you?",,,,,"Okay. And how much difficulty are you having when walking? Are you able to walk short distances without too much trouble, or is it more difficult than that?",,,
,,User,,"Well, short distances are still okay, but anything further than that is really tough. I start feeling really tired and my legs just don't want to cooperate anymore.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Alright, sounds like you might be dealing with some muscle weakness. Have you noticed any other changes in your body that could be connected to this? Like, has your weight shifted at all lately?",,,,,"Alright. That sounds like you may be experiencing some muscular weakness then. Have you noticed any other changes in your body that might be related to this? For example, has your weight changed at all recently?",,,
,,User,,"Now that you mention it, I have lost a few pounds recently. I'm not sure if that's related though.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,It might be. Losing weight can sometimes point to something going on with your health. Have you been feeling more tired than usual or noticed any shifts in your energy?,,,,,It could be. Weight loss can sometimes be a sign of an underlying health condition. Have you been feeling fatigued or having any other changes in your energy levels?,,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I've been really tired lately. It's hard to get out of bed in the morning, and I just don't have the energy to do much during the day.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Alright, those could definitely be signs of something deeper going on. We'll need to run some tests to figure out what's happening. For now, though, let's get you set up with a cane so it's easier for you to get around.",,,,,"Okay, those are all potential symptoms of an underlying health condition as well. We'll need to do some further testing to see what might be going on. In the meantime, though, we'll go ahead and get you a cane to help with your mobility.",,,
