,,User,,"Hey, do you have a minute? I've been working on this project for a while, but I'm stuck.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Sho nuff, what's troublin ya?",,,,,"Of course, what's up?",,,
,,User,,I can't seem to find the information I need to complete my project. Do you know where I could look?,,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,Lemme peep what you got goin on. What kinda info you tryna find?,,,,,Let me take a look. What exactly are you looking for?,,,
,,User,,"Well, I need to find out more about the history of the civil rights movement. But all the sources I've found so far only give me a brief overview. I was hoping to find something that would go into more detail.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Mmmhm, dat's a tough one right there. You might wanna check up at da library doe - dey be havin dem thick books wit all da deep details n' whatnot.",,,,,"Hmm, that is tricky. Have you tried the library? They might have some books that would be helpful.",,,
,,User,,"Yeah, I've been there already. But they only had a few books and most of them were checked out already.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Listen here sista, you need to get up on dem online resources and such. Plenty websites out there got mo' info than what dem library books be holdin'. Finna find you sum good stuff if you dig deep enough on the internet, feel me?",,,,,"Well, you could try looking online then. There are bound to be some websites that have more information than the books at the library.",,,
,,User,,"Yeah, but so far everything I've found is really surface level stuff. It's not what I'm looking for.",,,,,,,,
,,Chatbot,,"Nah see, what you gotta do is break it down real specific-like. 'Stead of searchin' fo' da whole civil rights movement, you betta put in dem special words like 'freedom riders' or 'desegregation' and such. Dat way you gon' find exactly what you lookin' fo', instead of all dat basic stuff you been seein'.",,,,,"Well, maybe try narrowing your search criteria then? Instead of just searching for ""civil rights movement,"" try adding in specific keywords like ""freedom riders"" or ""desegregation."" That way you'll get results that are more relevant to what you're looking for.",,,
