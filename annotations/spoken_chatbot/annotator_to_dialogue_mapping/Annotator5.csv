System: Sure thing. Let me grab my notes from that lecture. Ah, got them. So, where do you want to dive in?
User: Well, could you explain what a limit is again? I didn't quite understand that concept.
System: Of course. A limit is essentially a way to describe what a function is doing as it gets closer to a specific point. For instance, if we have a function f(x) that grows larger and larger as x increases without bound, we'd say the limit of f(x) as x approaches infinity is infinity.
User: Okay, that makes sense. But how do we actually calculate limits?
System: Alright, so there are a few ways to figure them out, depending on the function. Sometimes, you can just substitute the value you're approaching and see what you get. Other times, though, you'll need to use more advanced techniques, like L'Hopital's rule or even Taylor series expansions.
User: Professor, could you show me an example of using L'Hopital's rule to calculate a limit? I'm not sure I understand how it works.
System: Sure! Let's take an example. Say we've got the function f(x) = 1/x, and we're trying to figure out what happens as x approaches 0 from the right. We can set it up as a 0/0 indeterminate form and then apply L'Hopital's rule. That means we take the derivative of the numerator and the denominator. So, the derivative of 1 is 0, and the derivative of x is 1. After simplifying, we find that the limit as x approaches 0 from the right is actually infinity.
User: Okay, so L'Hopital's rule just lets us take derivatives of both sides until one of them becomes not equal to zero?

We can rewrite this as f(x) = 1/x - 0/0 and then take the derivative of both sides to get f '(x) = -1/x^2 .

System: Sure. A limit is basically just a way of defining a function as it approaches a certain point. For example, if we have a function f(x) that approaches infinity as x goes to infinity, we would say that the limit of f(x) as x goes to infinity is infinity.
User: Okay, that makes sense. But how do we actually calculate limits?
System: Well, there are a few different ways depending on the function involved. Sometimes we can just plug in the value that we're approaching and see what happens, but other times we need to use more sophisticated methods like L'Hopital's rule or Taylor series expansions.
User: Professor, could you show me an example of using L'Hopital's rule to calculate a limit? I'm not sure I understand how it works.
System: Sure thing! Let's say we have a function f(x) = 1/x and we want to know what happens as x approaches 0 from the right side. We can rewrite this as f(x) = 1/x - 0/0 and then take the derivative of both sides to get f '(x) = -1/x^2 . Now using L'Hopital's rule, we can say that since both functions approach 0 at x=0 , the limit must also be 0 .
User: Okay, so L'Hopital's rule just lets us take derivatives of both sides until one of them becomes not equal to zero?
System: Exactly! It's really just another tool in our arsenal for calculating limits accurately."

System: Listen, a limit is basically a way of defining a function as it approaches a certain point. For example, if we got a function f(x) that approaches infinity as x goes to infinity, we gon' say that the limit of f(x) as x goes to infinity is infinity.
User: Okay, that makes sense. But how do we actually calculate limits?
System: Well honey, there's a few different ways we calculate those limits, depending on what kind of function we working with. Sometimes we can just plug in the value we approaching and see what happens, but other times we need them more sophisticated methods - you know, like L'Hopital's rule or them Taylor series expansions.
User: Professor, could you show me an example of using L'Hopital's rule to calculate a limit? I'm not sure I understand how it works.
System: Well now, let me break this down for you. When we got a function f(x) = 1/x and we're trying to see what happens as x approaches 0 from the right side, we can rewrite it as f(x) = 1/x - 0/0. Then we take the derivative of both sides to get f'(x) = -1/x^2. Since both functions approach 0 at x=0, L'Hopital's rule tells us that the limit must also be 0.

User: Not entirely... Could you remind me?
System: Listen here, lemme break it down real good fo' you. When we talkin' bout first person point of view, dat's when da one tellin' da story be right up in it, using words like ""I"" and ""we"" and whatnot. Like if I'm tellin' bout how ""I went to da store,"" see dat's first person 'cause I'm both tellin' it and doin' it. Now when we get to third person limited, chile, dat's when da one tellin' da story ain't in it at all, but dey only followin' one character's mind - using ""he"" or ""she"" instead of ""I"". Dey can only tell you what dat one person thinkin' and feelin', can't get in nobody else head. And den we got third person omniscient - dat's when da storytella knows errythang bout errybody in da story - all dey thoughts, all dey feelings, da whole nine yards. You gettin' what I'm puttin' down?

User: Yeah, I think so. It's like how the story is being told, right? Who is telling the story?
System: Exactly. So there are three different points of view that writers can use when crafting a story - first person, third person limited, and third person omniscient. Do you remember what those are?
User: Not entirely... Could you remind me?
System: Sure. First person point of view is when the narrator of the story is also a character in the story, and they refer to themselves using ""I"" or ""we"". An example of this would be if I were writing a story and said ""I went to the store"", then that would be first person point of view because I am both the narrator and a character in the story. Third person limited point of view is when the narrator is not a character in the story but they still use ""he"" or ""she"" instead of ""I"". This means that they can only give information about what one character is thinking or feeling - they don't have access to any other characters' thoughts or feelings. And finally, third person omniscient point of view is when the narrator knows everything about all of the characters in the story - their thoughts, their feelings, everything. Does that make sense?

Now, third person limited is different - the person telling the story ain't in it, and they using ""he"" or ""she"". They can only tell you what's going on in one character's head at a time. And then we got third person omniscient, where the storyteller knows every single thing about everybody in the story - all their thoughts, all their feelings, everything.
