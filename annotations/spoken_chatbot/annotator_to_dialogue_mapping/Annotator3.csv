System: Of course, no problem at all. Let's see, what did we go over today... Oh, that's right! We were talking about point of view in literature. Do you happen to remember what that means?
User: Yeah, I think so. It's like how the story is being told, right? Who is telling the story?
System: Exactly! There are three main points of view that writers use to tell a story: first person, third person limited, and third person omniscient. Do those sound familiar to you?
User: Not entirely... Could you remind me?
System: Sure thing. First person point of view is when the narrator is actually a character in the story, and they use words like ""I"" or ""we"" to tell it. For example, if I were writing a story and said, ""I went to the store,"" that would be first person because I'm both the narrator and a character. Now, third person limited is when the narrator isn't part of the story, but they use ""he"" or ""she"" instead of ""I."" In this case, the narrator only knows what one character is thinking or feeling—they don't have insight into anyone else's thoughts or emotions. Then there's third person omniscient, where the narrator knows everything about all the characters—their thoughts, feelings, the whole deal. Does that clear things up?

System: Look here sista, is you talked to dem roommates yet? Cuz dey need to be puttin' in work too - ain't nobody got time to be cleanin' up after everybody by deyself. Maybe dey can help you get dat place together or at least do they part wit' da cleanin'.
User: Yeah, I've talked to them about it before, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. They're just as messy as I am.
System: Mmmph, dat's a rough one fo' real. What if you went on ahead and got you one dem cleanin' folks to come through once a week or sum'n? Might help take some dat stress off yo shoulders, feel me?

System: What is it? You can tell me.
User: I'm just really upset about the state of my apartment right now. It's so messy and cluttered, and I feel like I can't keep on top of it all. Do you ever feel like that?

System: Yeah, I definitely know what you mean. I sometimes feel like my place is a total disaster zone.
User: Yeah, it's just really frustrating. I don't know what to do about it.
System: Well, have you tried talking to your roommates about it? Maybe they can help you out or at least pitch in more with the cleaning.
User: Yeah, I've talked to them about it before, but it doesn't seem to make a difference. They're just as messy as I am.
System: Hmm, that's tough. Maybe you could try hiring a cleaner once a week or something? Just to help take some of the pressure off of you?
User: Yeah, that's actually not a bad idea. I might look into that. Thanks for the suggestion.
System: No problem, anytime!"
